## New KRACK Attack Against Wi-Fi Encryption

-  New KRACK Attack Against Wi-Fi Encryption Mathy Vanhoef has just published a devastating attack against WPA2, the 14-year-old encryption protocol used by pretty much all wi-fi systems

- Its an interesting attack, where the attacker forces the protocol to reuse a key

- The authors call this attack KRACK, for Key Reinstallation Attacks This is yet another of a series of marketed attacks; with a cool name, a website, and a logo

- The QA on the website answers a lot of questions about the attack and its implications

- And lots of good information in this ArsTechnica article. There is an Tom Wimmenhove has discovered a vulnerability in the key fob system used by several Subaru vehicles.

- By exploiting the vulnerability, a thief can clone a key fob and gain access to a vehicle with relative ease.

- Wimmenhove says he informed Subaru of the security flaw but was not taken seriously and the issue has not been patched. The key fob sends out a code which the car interprets to unlock the doors.

- By capturing a single packet from a working key fob, the attacker can use Wimmenhove's code to predict the next rolling code and unlock the car.

- The software can run on a Raspberry Pi and the antennas cost just a few dollars.

## Linux kernel community tries to castrate GPL copyright troll

![lurl](https://media1.giphy.com/media/Ot8nXtNRn9gek/giphy.gif?fingerprint=e1bb72ff59fcc6535579524649becf6c)

-  Linux kernel maintainer Greg Kroah-Hartman and several other senior Linux figures have published a Linux Kernel Community Enforcement Statement to be included in future Linux documentation, in order to ensure contributions to the kernel don't fall foul of copyright claims that have already seen a single developer win "at least a few million Euros. In a post released on Monday, October 16th, Kroah-Hartman explained the Statement's needed because not everyone who contributes to the kernel understands the obligations the GNU Public Licence 2.0 (GPL 2.0), and the licence has ambiguities ... that no one in our community has ever considered part of compliance. Those ambiguities, he writes, have been used by a developer named Patrick McHardy to run multiple copyright enforcement lawsuits.  Copyright in open source?

- The Hellwig vs. VMware case foundered on the fact that the plaintiff couldn't show exactly which lines the Linux kernel had made it into VMware products.  McHardy is a former contributor to a project called Netfilter that brings useful networking functionality such as network address translation to Linux.

- He's also been criticised by the Software Freedom Conservancy for prioritizing financial gain over compliance. Lawyer Heather Meeker believes that McHardy wrote well under .25% of the code in the kernel but has parlayed that into around 50 copyright complaints about Linux companies' use of Netfilter.

- We are also aware that these actions, which have continued for at least four years, have threatened the confidence in our ecosystem. To restore that confidence, the Statement adopts the same termination provisions we are all familiar with from GPL-3.0 as an Additional Permission giving companies confidence that they will have time to come into compliance if a failure is identified. Those provisions are:  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation. Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.  Their ability to rely on this Additional Permission will hopefully re-establish user confidence and help direct enforcement activity back to the original purpose we have all sought over the years  actual compliance, say Kroah-Hartman and his co-authors wrote. The Register has approached McHardy for comment, but as he's reportedly a reluctant correspondent when asked about his legal activities we don't hold out much hope of a reply.

- If he does respond, we'll either update this story or write a new one. If you've received a demand from McHardy, Netfilter recommends taking it seriously and ensuring compliance with the GPL.

## The Flawed System Behind the Krack Wi-Fi Meltdown

![lurl](https://media0.giphy.com/media/QnylzNImvxf8I/giphy.gif?fingerprint=e1bb72ff59fcc6544d474d455558fc86)

- On Monday, the security community scrambled to unpack Krack, a fundamental vulnerability in the ubiquitous, secure Wi-Fi network standard known a WPA2

- Though some of the most popular devices are mercifully already protected (like most of those that run Windows and iOS), a staggering population remains exposed to data theft and manipulation every time they connect to WPA2 Wi-Fi

- But as another interminable patching process begins, a different conversation is picking up, too, about how to catch flaws in crucial standards more quickly, and make it easier to patch them.No software is perfect

- Bugs are inevitable now and then

- But experts say that software standards that impact millions of devices are too often developed behind closed doors, making it difficult for the broader security community to assess potential flaws and vulnerabilities early on

- They can lack full documentation even months or years after their release."If there is one thing to learn from this, it's that standards can't be closed off from security researchers," says Robert Graham, an analyst for the cybersecurity firm

> "The bug here is actually pretty easy to prevent, and pretty obvious

- It's the fact that security researchers couldn't get their hands on the standards that meant that it was able to hide."The WPA2 protocol was developed by the Wi-Fi Alliance and the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), whic

## BoundHook: Microsoft downplays Windows systems exploit technique

![lurl](https://media0.giphy.com/media/SEQCoVccVrGQ8/giphy.gif?fingerprint=e1bb72ff59fcc656496a2e32519aa99c)

-  Features of the Intel MPX designed to prevent memory errors and attacks might be abused to launch assaults on Windows systems, security researchers claim. Windows 10 uses Intel to secure applications by detecting boundary exceptions (

- An exploit technique by CyberArk Labs uses the boundary exception as the hook itself to give attackers control of Windows 10 devices.

## Hack a BT Low Energy (BLE) butt plug

Welcome to 2017  Encrypted messaging app Telegram must pay 800,000 roubles for resisting Russia's FSB's demand that it help decrypt user messages. The fine translates to just under US$14,000, making it less of a serious punishment and more a shot across the bows. However, it does seem to entrench the principle that the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation (FSB) can demand decryption. Moscow signalled its intention to crack down last year with legislation put to the Duma, proposing fines up to a million roubles for the administrative offence of not giving keys to the FSB. Telegram's head office received its summons in July, according to this Russian-language report from the BBC.

- The summons demanded information about six numbers registered on the Telegram. Judge Yulia Danilchik of the 383 Meshchansky District Court of Justice made the guilty finding and imposed the fine. Telegram founder Pavel Durov has posted to Russian social site VK.com that it's not possible to comply. In addition to the fact that the requirements of the FSB are not technically feasible, they contradict Article 23 of the Constitution of the Russian Federation: 'Everyone has the right to privacy of correspondence, telephone conversations, postal, telegraphic and other communications,' he wrote. He indicated his intention to appeal, and keep doing so until the claim of the FSB is considered by a judge familiar with the basic law of Russia - its Constitution.

## Domino's Pizza delivers user details to spammers

![lurl](https://media3.giphy.com/media/3o6Zt8PYT58ydBNgpa/giphy.gif?fingerprint=e1bb72ff59fcc659776346617726491d)

-  Domino's Pizza's Australian outpost has blamed a partner for a security breach, after angry customers went online complaining about finding themselves on spam lists. The company owned up to the breach after Redditor Pinchie McPinch complained about receiving e-mails from Sarah and Jess. What tipped Pinchie that the data may have come from the pizza chain was that the spammers were referring to his/her favourite Domino's locations to make the approaches look more plausible. Domino's acknowledged the breach and said it is investigating what happened.

- The company blamed the breach on an unnamed former supplier. The company's statement says the breach was limited to email addresses, names and store suburbs (related to pizza orders) ... at no time has customer financial information (including credit cards) or passwords, been accessed or compromised. The statement added that the company will work closely with the relevant privacy authorities in Australia. Electronic Frontiers Australia board member Peter Tonoli isn't satisfied with Domino's handling of the situation:  How about @Dominos_AU contact their customers about the privacy breach, instead of relying of customers unawareness of the problem?

- Asking customers to email Dominos is disingenuous and opaque #privacy #databreach @OAICgov pic.twitter.com/Bw6f5bezxZ  Peter Tonoli (@peter_tonoli) October 17, 2017 It seems the unnamed supplier was a trans-Tasman operation, since last week similar complaints emerged in New Zealand. The Register has asked Domino's for comment.

- And a Supreme for lunch, plus a Coke Zero.*   *Not really.  Update: A Domino's spokesperson has sent a statement to The Register which mostly reproduces what is on its Website, but which confirms it has notified the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner of he breach.

## Here's a timeless headline: Adobe rushes out emergency Flash fix after hacker exploits bug

![lurl](https://media2.giphy.com/media/hfkIIZM4AsBW0/giphy.gif?fingerprint=e1bb72ff59fcc65b2e32736441cf5fba)

-  Adobe today issued an emergency security patch for Flash, which squashes a bug being used in the wild right now by hackers to infect Windows PCs with spyware. The flaw, CVE-2017-11292, was discovered by Kaspersky Labs, and affects all current versions of Flash for Windows, macOS, Linux and Chrome OS.

- Netizens should update their Flash installations as soon as possible. "This is a type confusion bug that could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on a target system," the Zero Day Initiative warned in an advisory.

> "The attacker would need to entice an affected system to view maliciously crafted Flash content, typically hosted on a website.

> " It's a demoralizing blow for Adobe, which just last week proudly trumpeting the fact that  for the first time in ages  there would be no security patches this month for its applications.

- Once opened, the Flash file exploits the memory-corruption bug to read and write memory as it pleases, which is used to execute an initial shellcode stage. This first stage disguises some of its code  the NOP sled  to avoid detection by antivirus packages, and downloads and runs a second stage called mo.exe. This executable is the latest version of FinFisher, the multitool spyware developed for government snoops by Gamma International that was dumped online and into the hands of crooks.

- Quarterly update for October is the smallest of the year: only 252 flaws to fix! Oracle advises to apply patches 'without delay.' Oracle this week urged administrators to apply security patches to their systems more quickly even

- Instead as it usually does, Oracle more generally cautioned customers about periodic reports it receives about intruders successfully breaking into organizations by exploiting vulnerabilities for which the company has already issued patches. "

- Two of the patched flaws are remotely exploitable without the need for any credentials. Oracle's October CPU also patches 22 Java SE vulnerabilities, says Chris Goettl, product manager at Ivanti

- Up to now in 2017, Oracle has fixed a total of 79 vulnerabilities in Java SE or more than double the 37 it addressed last year, Waratek noted

## MSI support for PCI device pass-through with stub domains

![lurl](https://media2.giphy.com/media/BoGbCkfklPumY/giphy.gif?fingerprint=e1bb72ff59fcc665394472625517d527)

-  Introduction In this post, we will describe how we fixed MSI support for VMs running in HVM mode in Qubes 4.0

- First, allow us to provide some background about the MSI feature and why we need it in the first place. In Qubes 4.0, we switched from paravirtualized (PV) virtual machines to hardware virtual machines (HVMs, also known as fully virtualized

- For VMs running as HVMs, Xen requires software that can emulate hardware (such as network cards) called QEMU in order to provide device emulation

- By default, Xen runs QEMU in the most trusted domain, dom0, and QEMU has quite a large attack surface

- Running QEMU in dom0 would jeopardize the security of Qubes, so it is necessary to run QEMU outside of dom0. We do this by using a Xen feature that allows us to run QEMU inside a second helper VM called a stub domain.* This way,

- Admittedly, stub domains run in PV mode, which means that an attacker who were to successfully exploit QEMU would gain the ability to exploit potential Xen bugs in paravirtualization

- Nonetheless, we believe using HVMs to host PCI devices is still a considerable improvement

- Of course, in the long term, we would like to switch to using PVH VMs, but at the moment this is not feasible. In our testing, we found that pass-through PCI devices did not work in HVMs on some machines

## Security flaws in smartwatches for children

-  The Norwegian Consumer Council has uncovered serious security and privacy flaws in smartwatches for children.

- Strangers can easily seize control of the watches and use them to track and eavesdrop on children.Together with the security firm Mnemonic, the Norwegian Consumer Council tested several smartwatches for children.

- We discovered significant security flaws, unreliable safety features and a lack of consumer protection. Its very serious when products that claim to make children safer instead put them at risk because of poor security and features that do not work properly, says Finn Myrstad, Director of Digital Policy at the Norwegian Consumer Council. Importers and retailers must know what they stock and sell.

- These are clear breaches of both the Norwegian Marketing Control Act and the Personal Data Act. See how the watches fail  Importers and manufacturers notified of the findings Ahead of publication of the report, the Consumer Council alerted the Norwegian Data Protection Authority, which in turn notified the importers and manufacturers in question to allow them to rectify the issues.

- The industry and the authorities both have a responsibility for ensuring that consumers are not put at risk by unsafe products, Finn Myrstad stated. Consumer organisations in Europe and the US will also be pursuing our findings with their respective authorities, both nationally and at an EU level. Consumer advice  We would refrain from buying these smartwatches until features and security standards are satisfactory. Ask the seller for your money back and point to the security failings, the features that do not work and the privacy breaches.  WatchOut Report Video about the security flaws

## BoundHook Attack Exploits Intel Skylake MPX Feature

![lurl](https://media1.giphy.com/media/3o6UB65bfF8P1anIZ2/giphy.gif?fingerprint=e1bb72ff59fcc67156617635414ecb9c)

- A post-intrusion technique developed by researchers at CyberArk Labs called BoundHooking allows attackers to exploit a feature in all Intel chips introduced since Skylake.

- The attack technique allows for the execution of code from any process without detection by antivirus software or other security measures, researchers said. According to CyberArk, a BoundHooking attack exploits the Intel feature called Memory Protection Extension (MPX) to hook function calls that pass between software components.

- That allows for an adversary to manipulate and spy on a wide range of Windows applications.Related Posts   Necurs-Based DDE Attacks Now Spreading Locky Ransomware   October 20, 2017 , 12:05 pm     Threatpost News Wrap, Oct. 20, 2017   October 20, 2017 , 10:15 am     Factorization Flaw in TPM Chips Makes Attacks on RSA Private Keys Feasible   October 16, 2017 , 2:05 pm    Some of the software that utilizes hooks include: application security solutions, system utilities, tools for programming, malicious software and others, said Kasif Dekel security researcher at CyberArk. Dekel said the prerequisite for its proof-of-concept attack are the presence of an Intel CPU (Skylake or after) running MPX concurrently with Windows 10 (64-bit or 32-bit).

- Adversaries must also have already fully compromised the targeted system. The beauty of these type attacks is that an adversarys actions can go undetected, said Doron Naim, senior security researcher at CyberArk. Researchers said the BoundHook technique, explained in a technical report released Wednesday, is able to cause an exception in a specific memory location in a user-mode context.

- We know that BoundHook does not meet Microsofts bar to be considered a vulnerability, as machine administrator rights are already compromised, the company wrote on its blog. In a message back to CyberArk from Microsoft responding to the researchers disclosure it wrote, we have completed our investigation of this issue and have found that it is not a vulnerability but a technique to avoid detection once the machine is already compromised. In lieu of a Microsoft patch, CyberArk researchers said admin should rein-in user account privileges to minimize the type of lateral and system penetration an adversary can carry out in a BoundHooking attack. There are two goals to publishing the research, Naim said.

- Destination ports are controlled by the attacker, so they can have the exploit pretend to be a legitimate user of some common service like www, and you're not going to block THAT.

-  You could try blocking by destination IP, but this would require prompting for user input every time something tries to reach an unknown machine.

- The company has updated its DRM protection methods with a number of "variants" since its rollout in 2014, and chatter in the cracking community indicates a revamped "version 5" will launch any day now.

- That might give publishers a little more breathing room where their games can exist uncracked and force the crackers back to the drawing board for another round of the never-ending DRM battle. BoingBoing post.

## Android getting "DNS over TLS" support to stop ISPs from knowing what websites you visit

-  Android getting DNS over TLS support to stop ISPs from knowing what websites you visit A DNS (Domain Name Server) is what translates a website address from a URL that you enter to an IP address which your computer actually connect

- For example, when you type www.xda-developers.com into your browser, your computer queries a DNS which looks up and returns the IP address 209.58.128.90 to the client

- This process is hidden from the user, but every website you visit (so long as it has a human-readable URL) will go through this same process

- The problem for those security conscious out there is that these requests are done in plain text through UDP or TCP protocols which are readable by anyone that can see your connection, including your ISP

- This is where DNS over TLS comes in. DNS over TLS is a protocol where DNS queries will be encrypted to the same level as HTTPS and thus a DNS cant actually log or see the websites you visit

- This uses TLS, or Transport Layer Security, to achieve this encryption

- This does require the DNS you are using to have DNS over TLS support, though, but its a start

- Users can switch to Googles DNS if they wish to benefit from DNS over TLS. It appears that DNS over TLS support is being added to Android,  Theres a weird feeling afoot these days, in the Valley, and in San Francisco

- Across the rest of the world  Denver, Santiago,  After last week we had the KRACK and ROCA cryptographic attacks, this week has gotten off to a similarly "great" start with the publication of a new crypto attack known as DUHK (Don't Use Hard-coded Keys). The issue at the heart of the DUHK attack is a combination of two main factors. The first is the usage of the ANSI X9.31 Random Number Generator (RNG).

- This is an algorithm that takes random data and generates encryption keys used to secure VPN connections, browsing sessions, and other encrypted traffic/data. The second factor needed for a DUHK attack is when hardware vendors use a hardcoded "seed key" for the ANSI X9.31 RNG algorithm.

- Normally, vendors should generate a random seed key at device startup or before launching the ANSI X9.31 algorithm. This means that when you have hardware/software products that combine ANSI X9.31 and deploy a hardcoded seed key, attackers can decrypt encrypted communications carried out through that device.

- This includes communications passing over VPN connections or encrypted web sessions that carry out login credentials, payment information, Intranet information, private enterprise data, and more. Old Fortinet FortiGate devices vulnerable to DUHK attacks The DUHK attack was discovered by two researchers from the University of Pennsylvania and one researcher from Johns Hopkins University. In a research paper they published today  entitled "Practical state recovery attacks against legacy RNG implementations"  researchers reveal they were able to recover encrypted traffic from Fortinet FortiGate devices used by companies across the world as firewalls or to create private VPN networks. The research team says they reversed engineered FortiGate firmware images and found the hard-coded seed key.

> " This is because vendors could have FIPS-compliant ANSI X9.31 implementations, but if they left a hard-coded seed key in the firmware, they automatically backdoored their own device's encryption. More details about the DUHK attack are available on this dedicated homepage, and in a blog post by Matthew Green, one of the researchers.

- to close an unresponsive session, like when a firewall has closed my connection. BREAK is useful for various things, usually getting back to a terminal server console or getting the attention of network equipment. The command line doesnt do much, but you can alter forwards from it.

- Ive never used it but its probably handy for troubleshooting if your tunnels arent working right: ssh ?

- You can mess with it via the RekeyLimit configuration directives, or read more about it in RFC 4344. Suspending SSH via tilde-Ctrl-Z is handy from time to time, especially when youre on the console of a machine that doesnt have screen or some other multiplexor on it (or you forgot to start one).

- Of course, you have to remember that when you need it, but now that youve read it maybe you will. List forwarded connections is handy for managing the forwards you might have created with the command line. Backgrounding SSH attempts to close all the connections, and will wait patiently for them to die.

- I have never needed this, because Im the impatient bastard that just tilde-periods them if they dont close right away. You can use the EscapeChar configuration directive to change the tilde, if that conflicts with something.

## TorPolice  A Novel Framework For Enforcing Access Control Policies Across the Tor Network

-  The Tor network represents the most popular anonymity network, which is currently used by millions of users all over the world

- Nevertheless, access control doesnt exist for users of the Tor network, which renders the network susceptible to malicious attacks and botnet abuse

- For instance, adversaries often exploit exit relay nodes utilizing them as stepping stones for various forms of malicious attacks, forcing service providers to use CAPTCHAs to exit relay nodes IP addresses or even blacklist them all, which results i

- TorPolice works via enabling abuse plagued service providers, e.g

- Yelp, to implement access rules to police and suppress malicious requests conveyed via the Tor network, while still offering network services to honest Tor users

- Even more so, TorPolice endows Tor with universal access control for relay nodes; thus, maximizing Tors immunity against botnet attacks

## Reaper Botnet

-  Reaper Botnet It's based on the Mirai code, but much more virulent: While Mirai caused widespread outages, it The rule in question was entered into the Federal Register by the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection in July; it prevents financial companies that bind their users by arbitration agreements from prohibiting those same users from suing as a class. The final rule prohibits covered providers of certain consumer financial products and services from using an agreement with a consumer that provides for arbitration of any future dispute between the parties to bar the consumer from filing or participating in a class action concerning the covered consumer financial product or service. Thats exactly like what the terms of Equifaxs services included when users went to the companys site to see if they were affected by the hack.

- Although the site in question appears to have been essentially useless, it shunted users into an Equifax-provided service with terms that bound disputes to be resolved via arbitration. Equifax later modified some of its terms to remove the arbitration clause, and also indicated in its TrustedID service FAQ that the clause applies to the free credit file monitoring and identity theft protection products, and not the cybersecurity incident. Nevertheless, its very unclear just what users may or may not have signed up for, and to what degree Equifax is protected by these terms.

- The BCFP rule was made to prevent major incidents like this one from having their legal repercussions partly nullified; H.J.

- Its entire purpose is to disapprove of that specific rule. It passed the House on July 25 231-190, split right down party lines except for one defecting Republican who voted nay with the Democrats.

## 'We've nothing to hide': Kaspersky Lab offers to open up source code

![lurl](https://media2.giphy.com/media/fhJVPzRZLy7Vm/giphy.gif?fingerprint=e1bb72ff59fcc68732683370555b7d7a)

-  Russian cybersecurity software flinger Kaspersky Lab has offered to open up its source code for third-party review. The firm's Global Transparency Initiative is in response to moves to ban the use of its technology on US government systems by the Department of Homeland Security over concerns of alleged ties with the Russian government. The initiative comes days after reports that Russian government hackers used Kaspersky antivirus software to siphon off classified material from a PC belonging to a NSA contractor.  With this initiative, Kaspersky Lab will engage the broader information security community and other stakeholders in validating and verifying the trustworthiness of its products, internal processes, and business operations, as well as introducing additional accountability mechanisms by which the company can further demonstrate that it addresses any security issues promptly and thoroughly.  An independent review of the company's source code by Q1 2018 will be followed by similar audits of its software updates and threat detection rules.

- A separate independent assessment of Kaspersky Lab's secure development lifecycle processes and its software and supply chain risk mitigation strategies will take place in parallel. Analysis of source code to rule out possible backdoors is all well and good but what really counts is how anti-malware software is configured to select what types of file are uploaded to the cloud for further scrutiny.

- The behaviour of the software can be and needs to be altered by updates. Kaspersky Lab further plans to open up three Transparency Centres worldwide (in Asia, Europe and the US) by 2020.

- In the meantime, the company has increased the value of its bug bounty awards to up to 75,000 ($100,000) for the most severe vulnerabilities. Eugene Kaspersky, chairman and chief exec, said the initiative was designed to re-establish trust and prevent the "balkanisation" of internet security. "Cybersecurity has no borders, but attempts to introduce national boundaries in cyberspace is counterproductive and must be stopped," Kaspersky said in a statement.

> " Lee Munson, security researcher for Comparitech.com, argued that the move had more to do with reputation management than transparency. "However Kaspersky Lab packages this new initiative, it is clear to me that this is about reputation repair, especially in the US where claims of links to Russian intelligence agencies have been severely damaging. "That it could build trust in the security community is true, though the trust being built for Kaspersky is obviously of paramount importance here."

## WHOIS embarrassed about security? APNIC, after database leaks

![lurl](https://media3.giphy.com/media/vX9WcCiWwUF7G/giphy.gif?fingerprint=e1bb72ff59fcc688435730306fef4b0f)

-  Asia's internet numbers registry APNIC has apologised to network owners after a slip in its WHOIS database config leaked credentials, including weakly-hashed passwords. The breach affected those in the regional registry's Maintainer and Incident Response Team (IRT) database objects.

- During a June 2017 upgrade, those details were included in downloadable WHOIS data. Maintainer is the administrative object that restricts who is allowed to edit other objects in the APNIC database; the IRT object identifies who receives abuse reports. Chris Barcellos of eBay's Red Team noticed the data on a third-party Website on October 12 and notified APNIC.

- The registry's deputy general director Sanjaya* writes that the database configuration was fixed on October 13, and subsequently the relevant passwords were reset. Had an attacker been able to recover the passwords, they could have altered WHOIS information or hijacked IP address blocks. As this configuration guide shows, one of the hash options available is crypt-pw, a weak and easily-reversed hash because it can only handle eight-character passwords. APNIC says it hasn't found evidence of malicious activity as the result of the breach.

- Had anybody altered the records, it would not have been permanent, since authoritative registry data is held internally by APNIC.

-  * Sanjaya uses just one name.

## Coin Hive hacked via old password to move manic miners' Monero into miscreants' pockets

![lurl](https://media2.giphy.com/media/WUjGvQ46MiQ6c/giphy.gif?fingerprint=e1bb72ff59fcc6893934757a67e1e674)

-  Monero miner maker Coin Hive was hacked so that websites using its code inadvertently redirected their generated cryptocurrency to miscreants  after the outfit forgot to change an old password. The team, which develops alt-coin mining JavaScript engines, said on Tuesday hackers had used an old Cloudflare account password to reconfigure coinhive.com's DNS settings.

- This allowed the thieves to briefly redirect downloads of its crypto-mining code to a malicious version that was hardcoded to funnel mined cyber-cash to one particular user.

- The plan is to credit all site owners with an additional 12 hours of Monero mining based on their daily average hashrate.

- One Monero coin, 1 XMR, is worth about $89 right now. The cockup highlights the dangers of reusing pass phrases and not setting up two-factor authentication for everything.

- So if you're reusing credentials on multiple systems, you'll eventually be caught out when one of those systems is compromised and the login details for, essentially, all your accounts are leaked. Your humble Reg hack had a similar experience a few months ago when, just minutes after replying on Twitter to a tweet by a far-right twit, someone almost logged into his Facebook account using a reused and leaked password.

## Nitrokey Start Supports Elliptic Curves (ECC) | Nitrokey

![lurl](https://media1.giphy.com/media/Axqr1hNEmGJiw/giphy.gif?fingerprint=e1bb72ff59fcc68c59512f326b068efe)

- RSA-2048 Becomes Increasingly Insecure For security reasons, the German Federal Office for Information Security (Bundesamt fur Sicherheit in der Informationstechnik or BSI) no longer recommends RSA keys with a length of 2048 bit be used after 2022.

- This method is considered to be just as secure for smaller key systems as longer RSA keys and is also considerably faster. Basics of Elliptic-Curve Cryptography In contrast to RSA, there are many different forms (so-called curves) of elliptic-curve cryptography.

- Fortunately the Nitrokey Start supports multiple curves, namely NIST, SECG and Curve25519.

- This article provides a good entry point for gaining a general understanding of elliptic-curve cryptography. System Requirements In order to create keys based on elliptic curves on the Nitrokey Start, firmware 1.2 and GnuPG version 2.1.16 or higher must be installed. You can read Nitrokey Starts firmware version via gpg card-status:  gpg --card-status Reader ...........: 20A0:4211:FSIJ-1.2.4-67083322:0 ... The digit after FSIJ indicates the state of the software  in this case it is 1.2.4.

- All communication partners must use GnuPG 2.1 or newer for email encryption by means of ECC, otherwise incompatibility issues might arise.

## AI Model Fundamentally Cracks Captchas, Scientists Say

-        Russian agents, who have taken a keen interest in the 2016 White House race, or potentially any miscreant on the planet. While investigating the Kennesaw State University's Center for Election Systems, which oversees Georgia's voting system, last year, security researcher Logan Lamb found its system was misconfigured, exposing the state's entire voter registration records, multiple PDFs with instructions and passwords for election workers, and the software systems used to tally votes cast. "You could just go to the root of where they were hosting all the files and just download everything without logging in," he said.

- He also noted the files had been indexed by Google, making them readily available to anyone looking in the right place. Despite Lamb letting the election center knows of his findings, the security holes were left unpatched for seven months.

- They asked for an independent security review of the server, expecting to find flaws that would lend weight to their argument for investment in a more modern and secure system. But emails released this week following a Freedom of Information Act request reveal that technicians at the election center deleted the server's data on July 7  just days after the lawsuit was filed. The memos reveal multiple references to the data wipe, including a message sent just last week from an assistant state attorney general to the plaintiffs in the case.

- That same email also notes that backups of the server data were also deleted more than a month after the initial wipe  just as the lawsuit moved to a federal court. It is unclear who ordered the destruction of the data, and why, but they have raised yet more suspicions of collusion between the Trump campaign team, the Republican Party, and the Russian government. So far, everyone is claiming ignorance of the event.

## Suicide Linux @ Things Of Interest

- You know how sometimes if you mistype a filename in Bash, it corrects your spelling and runs the command anyway? Such as when changing directory, or opening a file. I have invented Suicide Linux

- Any time - any time - you type any remotely incorrect command, the interpreter creatively resolves it into rm -rf / and wipes your hard drive. It's a game

- Like walking a tightrope

- You have to see how long you can continue to use the operating system before losing all your data. Update 2011-12-26 Suicide Linux now appears to be a genuine Debian packa

- Good show! A video demonstration is available

- The reaction from the OS is actually rather underwhelming

- You'd think the OS would raise some fairly urgent errors if you went around deleting parts of it? Perhaps rm -rf / should be replaced with something with more verbose flags set

- That way, when you run a bad command, you are told immediately that things are being deleted and you have a fighting chance to cancel the operation before your system becomes inoperable

- So if you want to use Java 8 language features, you need to use Android Studio 2.1 to build your app. Note: Instant Run is disabled when you enable the Jack compiler because they currently are not compatible. Although Android Studio 2.1 is now stable, the Jack compiler is still experimental and you must enable it with the jackOptions property in your build.gradle file. Other than the changes to support the N Preview, Android Studio 2.1 includes minor bug fixes and the following enhancements: ul liThe Java-aware C++ debugger is now enabled by default when you're  using an N device or emulator and select Native debugger mode (in the Debugger tab for your run/debug configuration).

-  Integrated the SDK Manager into Android Studio to simplify package and tools access and provide update notifications.

## uncaptcha

- Using browser automation software, we can interact with the target website and engage with the captcha, parsing out the necessary elements to begin the attack.

- We rely primarily on the audio captcha attack - by properly identifying spoken numbers, we can pass the reCaptcha programmatically and fool the site into thinking our bot is a human.

- Researchers have already identified minor weaknesses with the reCaptcha system - 9 days of legitimate (ish) interaction with Google's services is usually enough to lower the system's suspicion level significantly. How it works The format of the audio captcha is a varied-length series of numbers spaced out read aloud at varied speeds, pitches, and accents through background noise.

- Since that time, reCaptcha appears to include some additional protections that limit unCaptcha's success. For instance, Google has also improved their browser automation detection.

- Additionally, we have observed that some audio challenges include not only digits, but small snippets of spoken text. We encourage you to be careful when doing research in this field, to be mindful of local, state, and federal law, and to responsibly disclose any potential vulnerabilities to Google immediately. Additionally, we have removed our API keys from all the necessary queries.

## Mozilla devs discuss ditching Dutch CA, because cryptowars

-  Concerns at the effect of The Netherlands' new security laws could result in the country's certificate authority being pulled from Mozilla's trust list. The nation's Information and Security Services Act will come into force in January 2018.

- The law includes metadata retention powers similar to those enacted in other countries, and also grants broad-based interception powers to Dutch security services. Mozilla maintainers worry that interception could be enabled by abusing SSL proxying, giving rise to the proposal that the national CA  the CA of the Staat der Nederlanden  be taken off Firefox's automatic trust list. Chris Van Pelt, who reported the issue, writes: This revision of the law will authorise intelligence and security to intercept and analyse cable-bound (Internet) traffic, and will include far-reaching authorisations, including covert technical attacks, to facilitate their access to encrypted traffic. Article 45 1.b, explicitly authorises the use of 'false keys' in third party systems to obtain access to systems and data, he continues. Van Pelt also argues that the law reaches far beyond The Netherlands, since the country is home to major transit services into and out of Europe. Since the certificate authority in question is operated by The Netherlands' General Intelligence and Security Service (AIVD), Van Pelt suggests accepting the certificate is no longer appropriate. The proposal has yet to move beyond the initial Mozilla ticket.

The rainbow flag demonstration at a concert in Cairo has prompted a vicious crackdown.

-  Flag whips up moral panic When photos of the flag raised by Ahmed Alaa, a 22-year-old Egyptian law student, and his friends went viral, the expression of LGBTIQ solidarity quickly turned into a repressive campaign that has accelerated Egypt's attack on human rights under president Abdel Fattah al-Sisi.

- I submitted the following update to Didier, which should account for both the optional attribute and the fact that the XML can contain arbitrary spaces: w:fldChar\s+?w:fldCharType="begin"\s+?

- How should we bypass this? Going back to the Office Open XML File format (I love specifications), we identify that there is another element that we can use to reference field codes.

- If you decide to go with DDEAUTO AND include w:dirty="true", the end user will be prompted 3 times (not sure why three and not two) if they want to execute the DDE application.

- MSWord is nice enough to ask the user to disable protected view in order to see the document contents. For this, we can abuse another legacy feature (arent these great).

## [dns-operations] Surprisingly large cluster of domains sharing the same pair of 512-bit ZSKs and some more RSA key oddities

-  Looking closely at the data gathered by the DANE survey I've run into more than 54 thousand (!!!)

- The SOA records all point at wedos.cz, who appear to be some sort of hosting provider.

- Perhaps someone native to .CZ could reach out to them and suggest that 512-bit keys are no longer a good idea, especially if re-used so liberally!

- Two domains unrelated to the above have 512-bit keys with a weak exponent of 3: trt12.jus.br trt12.gov.br More broadly, the DNSKEY length (including exponent length and exponent) histogram (distinct RR count) for keys for algorithms 5, 7, 8 and 10 (RSA) is below, with some highlights annotated.

- It seems too many folks stray into uncharted waters with their DNSKEY parameter choices.

- In this paper, we propose a novel method for optically calculating extremely small adversarial perturbation (few-pixels attack), based on differential evolution.

- It requires much less adversarial information and works with a broader classes of DNN models.

- The results show that 73.8$\%$ of the test images can be crafted to adversarial images with modification just on one pixel with 98.7$\%$ confidence on average.

- In addition, it is known that investigating the robustness problem of DNN can bring critical clues for understanding the geometrical features of the DNN decision map in high dimensional input space.

- The results of conducting few-pixels attack contribute quantitative measurements and analysis to the geometrical understanding from a different perspective compared to previous works.

## Average Employee Manages Nearly 200 Passwords

![lurl](https://media2.giphy.com/media/105XRa8PBzUDV6/giphy.gif?fingerprint=e1bb72ff59fcc6af46764e6673482fae)

- But single sign-on support lacks in over 50% of the most popular websites and services used by workers.Employees use an average of 191 passwords to enter 154 times in a given month, racking up an estimated 36 minutes of password data entry during that time, according to a report released today. The Password Expose report, based on aggregated and anonymized data from over 30,000 LastPass customers, found that other industry reports often underestimate the number of credentials used and put the figure closer to an average of 27 passwords per employee. In addition to enterprise apps, employees often use dozens of other apps while at work, such as advertising and analytics platform apps as well as demonstration apps, the report notes. Meanwhile, companies and employees do not get full relief by using single sign-on (SSO) technology. Although a number of enterprise apps have SSO capabilities, more than 50% of the most popular websites and services, such as Box, MailChimp, and LinkedIn, do not support SSO out of the box, the report states. As a result, companies are left to put a business password manager in place to ensure all of those websites and services are "captured" and managed by IT policies, says Rachael Stockton, director of product strategy at LastPass. Password vaults with multifactor authentication are enabled in 26.5% of the companies included in the report, a level that lacks broad enough adoption to offset the problems that enterprises face with passwords, according to the report. "Multifactor authentication isn't supported widely enough across Web services, and isn't adopted frequently enough by businesses, to offset the risks that passwords pose," Stockton says.

> " Another recent study found that while corporate America's use of passwords remains prevalent, multifactor authentication is showing some signs of growth in the enterprise.

- LastPass, in a report from last year, found that 91% of users were aware of the risks of reusing passwords, yet 61% continued with the practice. Business and Personal Password Use IntermingledRoughly half of the top 36 popular websites that employees access for work are consumer solutions, such as Dropbox, Google, and Evernote, the report states.

- When an organization allows an employee to log in via Facebook, then it is leaving all the password policy control, such as two-factor authentication, password rotation, and number of characters to the end user and raises the risk that a weak password is protecting access to critical business data, she says. The second risk, Stockton observes, is that social media credentials are often reused and not very secure. "If one social media website has a security incident, there's increased risk that attackers will find re-used credentials to access corporate accounts," she says.

## Bypassing Browser Security Warnings with Pseudo Password Fields

![lurl](https://media3.giphy.com/media/3o6MbfdywJmn5V4IA8/giphy.gif?fingerprint=e1bb72ff59fcc6af46764e66736c98ad)

- For example, imagine you genuinely wanted to run a device requiring mains power in the centre of your inflatable pool - you're flat out of luck, right?

- That really ramped up in Jan when both Chrome and Firefox started displaying warnings when a login form was served insecurely.

- No really, someone has actually done this: This actually came through to me just yesterday via someone who described the chat they'd had with a representative from ShopCambridge.ca as follows:  Ive been speaking with the owner about SSL before I invest in becoming a member, but shes been told by the dev of the platform (its a franchise system called ShopCity.com) that SSL is more about Googles monopolizing visibility of content, and less to do with security  I'll come back to ShopCity.com a bit later, for now, let's break this down and marvel at the magic of what's going on here: Firstly, the browser warnings about an insecure login only fire when there is an input type of "password".

- More specifically, it's a pseudo password field designed to fool the user and deny them of the browser's visual warning designed to protect their password. Both the JS to add the class and the CSS to apply the font have both been added inline in the page source too, as though it's an afterthought:  Actually, that same block of JS and CSS is in there twice, once on line 1,111 and again on line 1,156.

- Oh, and incidentally, the font they're using has been around for at least 2 and a half years which well and truly pre-dates the browser security warnings this "fix" has been designed to address. This is clearly ridiculous and it didn't happen by accident either.

- A Russian law that bans the use or provision of virtual private networks (VPNs) will come into effect Wednesday.

- The legislation will require ISPs to block websites that offer VPNs and similar proxy services

- It was signed by President Vladimir Putin on July 29 and was justified as a necessary measure to prevent the spread of extremism online

- Among those banned websites are Wikipedia

- But the bigger issue and concern are short-term bans that have been repeatedly placed on news websites when they report on topics that the Russian government considers sensitive.

- It gets worse

- At the same time as Putin signed the VPN legislation, he signed another that will come into effect in January. That law, like a similar one passed by the Chinese government earlier this year, will require operators of messaging services to verify their users' identities through phone numbers

- At the same time, Russia is using its sway at the United Nations to push a much more restrictive approach to the internet
