This coming month&amp;rsquo;s meeting is Pee Edition in memoriam to our good friend Paul (PEE) who passed away in the previous month. Pee had been involved with 2600, Interlock, Security B-Sides Rochester and tons of other groups but mostly just a friend to all.
We&amp;rsquo;re still holding an open meeting. Please join. We&amp;rsquo;ll go through the monthly infosec news and try to make the same sarcastic comments that he would have.</description>

Meetings Meetings occur the first Friday of every month and consist of presentations from people in the community.
