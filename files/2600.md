## Drone-maker DJI's Go app contains naughty Javascript hot-patching framework

- Updated Chinese drone firm DJI appears to have baked a hot-patching framework into its Go app that breaks Apple's App Store terms and conditions, according to drone hacker sources. The patching framework in question, JSPatch, appears to be baked into the iOS version of Go.

- Both Tinker and JSPatch allow silent updates which could use existing permissions in new ways not previously disclosed to the user. The support person for DJI in the US commented in another thread about JSPatch that they "have been told both Android and iOS will have this functionality removed in the next release". We have asked Apple for comment and will update if and when we hear back. Earlier this month the US Army ordered all of its formations to stop using DJI products, including drones and apps, citing unspecified "cyber vulnerabilities". It is not difficult to draw a line between the remote update facilities uncovered by users cracking into DJI's software and the US Army's decision, though at the time the American military declined to reveal further details and DJI's public position was that it had no idea what upset the Pentagon. DJI representatives did not respond to our request to explain the JSPatch/Tinker situation, having said only that they needed to talk to the company's "overseas technical team" first.

- DJI is a Chinese firm, though it has extensive consumer-facing operations in the West. However, the company did announce it is launching a "local data mode" that "stops internet traffic to and from its flight control apps".

- " Local data mode appears to be similar to enabling flight mode on a mobile phone: the firm says its use will block all updates to maps, geofencing information, new flight restrictions and other software updates. This is a clear response to the US Army ban on all DJI equipment, presumably in the hope that stopping the drones and their associated apps phoning home to China (pictures and videos can be synced with DJI's Flickr-style drone photo-sharing website) will soothe the US military's concerns. We have asked the US Army if it will restart use of DJI products following this announcement and will update this article if we hear back from them. British police forces are making increasing use of drones as cheap alternatives to full-blown helicopters.

- That these aircraft rely on apps which could have been silently tweaked to allow a third party access to live surveillance data gathered by police is undesirable, to say the least.

## Breaking up the Container Monolith

- Dan has long been a technical leader in the container and SELinux spaces and is an amazing guy. If you take a moment to think back to the PDF format, it was originally created by Adobe to solve representing a document in a consistent way.

- The runtime standard allows the PDF-like tool chain ecosystem. These various components make up the bare minimum for running a container.

- Think of Apache when started at boot, listening on privileged ports, reading local content, etc. Improved Storage Read-only container images should be the default, but they are not currently.

- Rather than having to push new containers to a registry, just so all your OpenShift nodes can download it, wastes a ton of CPU, storage, and network resources.

- Kubernetes communicates with CRI-O, which in turn executes the container. Dans team at Red Hat has been focused on bringing open source development, principles and concepts to the container lifecycle.

## Open AWS S3 bucket leaked hotel booking service data

- 

- Another day, another misconfigured AWS storage bucket leaking corporate data, this time from hotel booking service Groupize. The find was made by Kromtech Security Center researchers and is detailed at MacKeeper. The discovery has sparked a spat between Kromtech and Groupize, with the latter denying that anything sensitive leaked. Au contraire, writes MacKeeper's Bob Diachenko, claiming that before they were locked down on August 15 the exposed folders included nearly 3,000 documents detailing contracts or agreements between hotels, customers and Groupize, including credit cards payment authorization forms, with full CC#, expiration date and CVV code, a leads folder with more than 3,000 spreadsheets, and another folder with more than 32,000 menus, images and more. Diachenko says Kromtech first notified Groupize on August 9. The company told Kaspersky's Threatpost it's grateful for Kromtech shedding light on a potential vulnerability, and added that it's been in touch with customers about the issue and "... steps weve taken to further secure our systems. The Register has contacted Groupize for comment. AWS S3 leaks, due to customer configuration blunders, are becoming the flavour of 2017.

- Verizon leaked 14 million customer records, and other open buckets researchers have spotted include those belonging to Dow Jones, voting machine supplier ESS (both found by former MacKeeper security bod Chris Vickery). In his new job at UpGuard, Vickery also turned up a bunch of sensitive US geospatial data, while Kromtech went public about WWE fan data leaking in July. With white-hat-plus-dog Googling for password AWS, we expect plenty of others will emerge, even though the default configuration for new AWS storage is that it's private. Earlier this month, Amazon unveiled its patrol bot service Macie, which tries to identify and help shut down unsecured corporate data repositories.

## CIA uses a secret tool to spy on NSA, FBI and other intel partners

-                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           2 NN14NN2                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Apparently, nobody's exempt from the CIA's intelligence gathering, not even its own intelligence partners

- According to a set of documents published by WikiLeaks, the CIA uses a tool called "ExpressLane" that hides behind a fake software update to collect information from agencies around the world that use its biometric collection system

- In the US, the list includes fellow government agencies like the FBI, the NSA and Homeland Security

- These partners are supposed to share data with the CIA, but clearly, the intelligence service wants to make sure they're not keeping anything from the agency.                                                                                                                                                                Based on the info written in the documents, the CIA pre-installed ExpressLane in the systems of newer partners

- For older ones, it gets installed by an agent personally visiting a partner site under the guise of installing a software update

- ExpressLane disguises itself as a harmless exe file in Windows' System 32 folder, but it actually collects files of interest

- When an agent inserts a thumb drive to run the fake software update, ExpressLane automatically uploads the compressed and encrypted files it gathered

- That thumb drive will also install a "kill date" that disrupts the system by a certain date, forcing the partner to call the CIA for service

## ziVA: Zimperium's iOS Video Audio Kernel Exploit - Zimperium Mobile Security Blog

-                             ziVA: Zimperiums iOS Video Audio Kernel Exploit                                        Adam Donenfeld                iOS                Aug 23 2017                                                            Follow @doadamFollowing my previous post, Im releasing ziVA: a fully chained iOS kernel exploit that (should) work on all the iOS devices running iOS 10.3.1 or earlier

- The exploit itself consists of multiple vulnerabilities that were discovered all in the same module: AppleAVEDriver.The exploit will be covered in depth in my HITBGSEC talk held on August 25th.For those of you who are not interested in iOS research and would like to protect themselves against these vulnerabilities, we urge you to update your iOS device to the latest version

- Without an advanced mobile security and mitigation solution on the device (such as Zimperium zIPS), theres little chance a user would notice any malicious or abnormal activity.The POC is released for educational purposes and evaluation by IT Administrators and Pentesters alike, and should not be used in any unintended way.The CVEs explanations, as written by Apple, can be found here.iOS vulnerabilities discovered and reported to AppleAVEVideoEncoderAvailable for: iPhone 5 and later, iPad 4th generation and later, and iPod touch 6th generationImpact: An application may be able to gain kernel privilegesDescription: Multiple memory corruption issues were addressed with improved memory handling.CVE-2017-6989: Adam Donenfeld (@doadam) of the Zimperium zLabs TeamCVE-2017-6994: Adam Donenfeld (@doadam) of the Zimperium zLabs TeamCVE-2017-6995: Adam Donenfeld (@doadam) of the Zimperium zLabs TeamCVE-2017-6996: Adam Donenfeld (@doadam) of the Zimperium zLabs TeamCVE-2017-6997: Adam Donenfeld (@doadam) of the Zimperium zLabs TeamCVE-2017-6998: Adam Donenfeld (@doadam) of the Zimperium zLabs TeamCVE-2017-6999: Adam Donenfeld (@doadam) of the Zimperium zLabs TeamIOSurfaceAvailable for: iPhone 5 and later, iPad 4th generation and later, and iPod touch 6th generationImpact: An application may be able to gain kernel privilegesDescription: A race condition was addressed through improved locking.CVE-2017-6979: Adam Donenfeld (@doadam) of the Zimperium zLabs Team I will provide an in depth analysis of the vulnerabilities and exploitation techniques at HITBGSEC

- After the conference, I will publish the rest of the disclosures as well as my slides and whitepaper.A brief description of one of the vulnerabilities, CVE-2017-6979:The function IOSurfaceRoot::createSurface is responsible for the creation of the IOSurface object

- It receives an OSDictionary, which it forwards to the function IOSurface::init.IOSurface::init parses the properties and in case one of these are invalid (e.g, a width that exceeds 32 bits), returns 0, and the creation of the IOSurface is halted.The IOSurfaceRoot object must hold a lock while calling IOSurface::init because IOSurface::init adds the IOSurface object to the IOSurfaceRoots list of surfaces.Heres the code that used to call IOSurface::init before Apples fix:surface = (IOSurface *)OSMetaClass::allocClassWithName(IOSurface);IORecursiveLockLock(provider-iosurface_array_lock);if ( !surface ){    IORecursiveLockUnlock(provider-iosurface_array_lock);    return 0;}init_ret_code = surface-init(surface, provider, task_owner, surface_data);/*     At this point, the surfaces list is unlocked,     and an invalid IOSurface object is in the list */IORecursiveLockUnlock(provider-iosurface_array_lock);if ( !init_ret_code ){  surface-release(surface);  return 0;}In case the IOSurface::init function fails, IORecursiveLockUnlock will be called.A bogus IOSurface object will still be in the system and in the IOSurfaceRoots list of surfaces (thus accessible to everyone).At this particular moment, an attacker can increase the refcount of the IOSurface (creating, for instance, an IOSurfaceSendRight object attached to the surface) and prevent the bogus IOSurface object from being destroyed.This leads to the creation and existence of an IOSurface in the kernel which the attacker controls its properties (IOSurface-width = -1 for example).Such an IOSurface object can be given to other mechanisms in the kernel which might rely on a valid width/height/one of the properties to work, thus causing heap overflows/other problems that might lead to an elevation of privileges by the attacker.Our proposed solution to Apple was to call IOSurface::release while the lock provider-iosurface_array_lock is still held

- Therefore moving the IORecursiveLockUnlock call just below IOSurface::release and putting it after the entire if statement would fix the problem because the IOSurfaceRoots list of surfaces will only be available once the bogus IOSurface is already cleaned up.Further reverse engineering of the function reveals that Apple changed the code according to our suggestions:surface = (IOSurface *)OSMetaClass::allocClassWithName(IOSurface);IORecursiveLockLock(provider-iosurface_array_lock);if ( !surface ){    IORecursiveLockUnlock(provider-iosurface_array_lock);    return 0;}init_ret_code = surface-init(surface, provider, task_owner, surface_data);if ( !init_ret_code ){    surface-release(surface);         /*         Here our bad surface is freed *before* the kernel unlocks the surfaces list,         Hence our bad surface is not accessible at anytime in case IOSurface::init fails

-      */    IORecursiveLockUnlock(provider-iosurface_array_lock);    return 0;}IORecursiveLockUnlock(provider-iosurface_array_lock);The issues are severe and could lead to a full device compromise

- The vulnerabilities ultimately lead to an attacker with initial code execution to fully control any iOS device on the market prior to version 10.3.2.Fortunately, we responsibly disclosed these bugs to Apple and a proper fix was coordinated

## W.H. cybersecurity coordinator warns against using Kaspersky Lab software

- WASHINGTON -- Rob Joyce, the Trump administration's cybersecurity coordinator, said Tuesday the U.S. is lacking 300,000 cybersecurity experts needed to defend the country.

- U.S. officials believe the company has ties to the Kremlin -- and the federal government has vowed not to use its products.

- CBS News has confirmed that FBI officials have met with private industry representatives to relay concerns about Kaspersky Lab, which is a Moscow-based cybersecurity company with suspected ties to Russian intelligence.Rob Joyce CBS News FBI agents have also interviewed Kaspersky employees working in the U.S."I don't use Kaspersky Lab products," Joyce told CBS News' Jeff Pegues Tuesday in an exclusive interview.He is also warning consumers against using the company's popular anti-virus software."Would you advise your family, your parents to use it?"

- In fact, there are more than 400 million users worldwide.The fear is Kaspersky's anti-virus software, which is supposed to protect users from malicious activity, could actually provide Russian intelligence with valuable information.And as a Russian certificate shows, the company is registered with the FSB, one of Russia's intelligence agencies.Eugene Kaspersky, the company's founder, once served in Russia's Ministry of Defense and is a graduate of a computer school tied to Russian intelligence.The company denies the accusations, calling them "false allegations."

- officials dismiss the denials, and continue to warn about the software."As cyber czar do you think more should be done to get the word out to the public not to use it?"

## Cryptology ePrint Archive: Report 2017/713

- More  is  Less:  How  Group  Chats  Weaken  the  Security  of  Instant  Messengers  Signal,  WhatsApp,   and  ThreemaPaul  Rosler   and  Christian  Mainka   and  Jorg  SchwenkAbstract: Secure  Instant  Messaging (SIM)  is  utilized  in  two  variants:  one-to-one  communication   and  group  communication

- While  the  first  variant  has  received  much  attention  lately (Frosch  et  al.,  EuroSP16;  Cohn-Gordon  et  al.,  EuroSP17;  Kobeissi  et  al.,  EuroSP17),  little  is  known  about  the  cryptographic  mechanisms   and  security  guarantees  of  SIM  group  communication.In  this  paper,  we  investigate  group  communication  security  mechanisms  of  three  main  SIM  applications:  Signal,  WhatsApp,   and  Threema

- We  first  provide  a  comprehensive   and  realistic  attacker  model  for  analyzing  group  SIM  protocols  regarding  security   and  reliability

- We  then  describe   and  analyze  the  group  protocols  used  in  Signal,  WhatsApp,   and  Threema

- By  applying  our  model,  we  reveal  multiple  weaknesses,   and  propose  generic  countermeasures  to  enhance  the  protocols  regarding  the  required  security   and  reliability  goals

- Our  systematic  analysis  reveals  that (1)  the  communications  integrity   represented  by  the  integrity  of  all  exchanged  messages    and (2)  the  groups  closeness   represented  by  the  members  ability  of  managing  the  group   are  not  end-to-end  protected.We  additionally  show  that  strong  security  properties,  such  as  Future  Secrecy  which  is  a  core  part  of  the  one-to-one  communication  in  the  Signal  protocol,  do  not  hold  for  its  group  communication.Category / Keywords: applications / End-to-End Encryption, Group Communication, Broadcast, Future Secrecy, Signal, WhatsApp, ThreemaDate: received 24 Jul 2017, last revised 28 Jul 2017Contact author: paul roesler at rub deAvailable format(s): PDF   BibTeX CitationVersion: 20170728:104838 (All versions of this report)Short URL: ia.cr/2017/713Show discussion  Start new discussion[ Cryptology ePrint archive ]

## Rowhammmer RAM attack adapted to hit flash storage  The Register

- It's Rowhammer, Jim, but not as we know it: IBM boffins have taken the DRAM-bit-flipping-as-attack-vector trick found by Google and applied it to MLC NAND Flash. Google's Project Zero found Rowhammer in 2015, when they demonstrated that careful RAM bit-flipping in page table entries could let an attacker pwn Linux systems. Since the bug upsets the operating system by attacking memory rather than looking for developers' errors, it's potent even if it's limited to types of memory that aren't protected by error checks (such as ECC in newer RAM). Ever since Project Zero's initial result, boffins have looked for other vectors or other victims (for example, it was turned into an Android root attack in 2016). Enter a group of boffins from IBM Research Zurich, who plan to demo a Rowhammer attack on MLC NAND flash after explaining it at this week's Usenix-organised W00T17 conference in Vancouver. Scary?

- Yes, but there's a couple of slivers of good news: it's a local rather than a remote attack, and the researchers constrained themselves to a filesystem-level attack rather than a full-system attack. The bad news is that Rowhammer-for-NAND can work at lower precision than its ancestor: while the original Google research worked by flipping single bits,  the attack primitive an attacker can obtain from MLC NAND flash weaknesses is a coarse granularity corruption. In other words, their weaker attack primitive ... is nevertheless sufficient to mount a local privilege escalation attack. To get that far, the research explain in this paper [PDF], an attack has to beat protections at all layers from the Flash chip up to the operating system:  

- The Flash controller's scrambling and error correction codes, that are designed to increase device reliability;

- Wear-levelling and block placement algorithms in the SSD controller make memory placement less predictable, from the attacker's point of view;

- Filesystem protections like caching and error detection have to be bypassed.   Only then does the attacker get to present their payload. A successful privilege escalation is shown in the video below:  Youtube Video  In a Linux ext3 filesystem formatted in 4 KB block sizes, an attacker who can create a 100 GB file has a 99.7 per cent chance of a successful exploit, the researchers note. The particular characteristic of Linux that make the attack possible is the inode, which stores the attributes and (importantly for this attack) disk block locations of an object's data: An indirect block is written (by the kernel filesystem driver) as soon as a file becomes larger than 12 blocks in size: this write is therefore very easy to time and trigger for the attacker. While they only went as far as writing a local exploit, the authors note that remote attack scenarios are feasible, through something like Javascript in a browser: Because browsers do allow writes and reads to the filesystem (albeit indirectly), through web content local caching, cookies, or use of the HTML5 storage API, it may be feasible to extend the attack vector presented here to remote attacks. The best defence, they note, is disk encryption with something like dm-crypt.

## Rowhammer RAM attack adapted to hit flash storage

-                                 It's Rowhammer, Jim, but not as we know it: IBM boffins have taken the DRAM-bit-flipping-as-attack-vector trick found by Google and applied it to MLC NAND Flash.                Google's Project Zero found Rowhammer in 2015, when they demonstrated that careful RAM bit-flipping in page table entries could let an attacker pwn Linux systems.                Since the bug upsets the operating system by attacking memory rather than looking for developers' errors, it's potent even if it's limited to types of memory that aren't protected by error checks (such as ECC in newer RAM).                Ever since Project Zero's initial result, boffins have looked for other vectors or other victims (for example, it was turned into an Android root attack in 2016).                Enter a group of boffins from IBM Research Zurich, who plan to demo a Rowhammer attack on MLC NAND flash after explaining it at this week's Usenix-organised W00T17 conference in Vancouver.                Scary? Yes, but there's a couple of slivers of good news: it's a local rather than a remote attack, and the researchers constrained themselves to a filesystem-level attack rather than a full-system attack.                The bad news is that Rowhammer-for-NAND can work at lower precision than its ancestor: while the original Google research worked by flipping single bits,  the attack primitive an attacker can obtain from MLC NAND flash weaknesses is a coarse granularity corruption.                In other words, their weaker attack primitive ... is nevertheless sufficient to mount a local privilege escalation attack.                To get that far, the research explain in this paper [PDF], an attack has to beat protections at all layers from the Flash chip up to the operating system:                Cell-to-cell interference protections on the chip.The Flash controller's scrambling and error correction codes, that are designed to increase device reliability;Wear-levelling and block placement algorithms in the SSD controller make memory placement less predictable, from the attacker's point of view;Filesystem protections like caching and error detection have to be bypassed.                Only then does the attacker get to present their payload.                A successful privilege escalation is shown in the video below:                  Youtube Video                In a Linux ext3 filesystem formatted in 4 KB block sizes, an attacker who can create a 100 GB file has a 99.7 per cent chance of a successful exploit, the researchers note.                The particular characteristic of Linux that make the attack possible is the inode, which stores the attributes and (importantly for this attack) disk block locations of an object's data: An indirect block is written (by the kernel filesystem driver) as soon as a file becomes larger than 12 blocks in size: this write is therefore very easy to time and trigger for the attacker.                While they only went as far as writing a local exploit, the authors note that remote attack scenarios are feasible, through something like Javascript in a browser:                Because browsers do allow writes and reads to the filesystem (albeit indirectly), through web content local caching, cookies, or use of the HTML5 storage API, it may be feasible to extend the attack vector presented here to remote attacks.                The best defence, they note, is disk encryption with something like dm-crypt

-

## Mozilla Fixes 29 Vulnerabilities in Firefox, Makes Flash Click-To-Activate

- Mozilla fixed three critical vulnerabilities when it released Firefox 55 on Tuesday, including bugs that could have triggered a crash of the browser and allowed for the execution of arbitrary code.The code execution vulnerability stems from an XUL injection vulnerability due to improper sanitization of the web page source code

- XUL, or XML User Interface Language, is Mozillas language for building app interfaces

- Frederik Braun, a Berlin-based security engineer for Mozilla who found the vulnerability, cautions the bug could allow for code execution if a user opened a malicious page with the browsers style editor developer tool.Related PostsFoxit to Fix PDF Reader Zero Days by FridayAugust 22, 2017 , 12:33 pmFlashs Final Countdown Has BegunAugust 16, 2017 , 1:59 pmPatched Flash Player Sandbox Escape Leaked Windows CredentialsAugust 10, 2017 , 3:00 pmThe other two critical bugs, use-after-free vulnerabilities, could have led to exploitable crashes.One could have occurred in the browsers WebSockets technology if an object holding the connection is freed before the disconnection operation is finished. The second bug, uncovered by longtime bug hunter Nils, could have occurred while re-computing layout for a marquee element during window resizing where the updated style object is freed while still in use.A handful of other issues, including four additional use-after-free vulnerabilities, a buffer overflow, and a same-origin bypass, all marked high severity, were also fixed on Tuesday

- The bugs could be used to bypass memory protections, lead to information disclosure, or like the critical vulnerabilities, lead to a crash.Twenty-nine vulnerabilities in total were fixed with Firefox 55, the first iteration of the browser to turn on click-to-activate functionality for Flash by default.The move has been in the works for years

- Mozilla first enabled click to play for virtually all plugins, except the latest release of Flash, back in 2013.Previous versions of Firefox gave users the option to disable Flash by default

- By allowing Flash to run on demand, the browser would prompt users whether they wanted to activate the software upon navigating to a page that required it.The move comes a few weeks after Adobe announced that it would finally kill off Flash in 2020.Benjamin Smedberg, a senior engineering manager at Mozilla, said shortly after Adobes announcement that Firefox was planning on disabling Flash by default in 2019

- Firefoxs Extended Support Release (ESR) version will allow users to continue using Flash until the end of 2020.In order to preserve user security, once Flash is no longer supported by Adobe security patches, no version of Firefox will load the plugin, Smedberg wrote.

## How Peter Thiel's Secretive Data Company Pushed Into Policing | Backchannel

- Palantir Law Enforcement provides robust, built-in privacy and civil liberties protections, including granular access controls and advanced data retention capabilities, its website reads.But DeBrabander had a hard time getting Palantir to respond, emails show.

- Four months later, his case was still visible to other officers, and he was still sending emails to Palantir to fix the problem.Law enforcement accounts for just a small part of Palantirs business, which mostly consists of military clients, intelligence outfits like the CIA or Homeland Security, and large financial institutions.

- Palantir partnered with us on [an] experiment to come up with [a] situational awareness tool.Illustration by Val MinaThat pilot soon evolved into an investigative analysis platform that could access databases of crime reports and license plate information.

- Cops could soon narrow license plate searches by area, follow inmates in custody, and even track diseases through jailsall from the mobile data terminals in their patrol cars.We started to sunset other applications in favor of Palantir because there wasnt another system out there that [could do] these kind of mission-critical analytic tasks, says Sergeant Peter Jackson of the LASD and JRIC.

- Their software collects data within certain geographical areas from multiple sources, and is used to provide regular, automatic intelligence updates on critical infrastructure sitessimilar to how your Facebook feed scours hundreds of friends pages to produce a rolling digest of what it thinks are the most interesting posts.

## Samsung browser comes to an Android near you -- if you want it

- Like other modern browsers from Google, Apple, Mozilla, Microsoft and Opera, it can synchronize your bookmarks and open tabs.

- However, if you want to sync with a browser on your personal computer, you'll have to install Samsung's Chrome extension.

-                          The new version  includes a high-contrast display mode to make the browser easier to use for people with visual impairments.

- It's got a selection of ad blockers built into the menu -- joining rivals Brave and Opera with another warning to the online ad industry that there's a real backlash to their technology.Also included, though disabled by default, is support for WebVR, a technology that brings virtual reality to browsers.

- Google already ships WebVR support in its Android version of Chrome, and on Tuesday, Mozilla added WebVR support to its Firefox browser for personal computers.Samsung bases its browser on Chromium, the open-source project behind Chrome, but is eager to have you know it's not just copying and pasting Google's work."We don't just pull in features from Chromium but actively contribute into them and into web standards," Samsung Internet developer advocate Peter O'Shaughnessy said in a blog post.

## Uncle Sam outlines evidence against British security whiz Hutchins

-                                 Court documents filed Wednesday in the trial of British security expert and accused malware writer Marcus Hutchins have outlined the very limited evidence the US government is willing to throw at the case.                Hutchins came into the limelight after crippling the WannaCry ransomware attack earlier this year

- He came over to the US from the UK for the DEF CON security conference season last month, and while waiting to fly back to Blighty was arrested by the FBI, with the British authorities looking the other way

- The 23-year-old was charged with coding and selling the Kronos banking malware, which is still in circulation today.                Hutchins denies any wrongdoing.                This week's filing [PDF], to the Wisconsin court where Hutchins will be tried, shows that US prosecutors will submit two CDs of audio content  one from when the Brit was interrogated for 24 hours by FBI agents without access to a lawyer, and the other containing audio recordings from where he was held in county jail in Nevada.                The FBI has also submitted a disturbingly non-specific "3-4 samples of malware" and 150 pages of transcripts from Jabber chats between Hutchins and an unidentified individual.                Also included are another 350 pages of transcribed chats on an internet forum

- These were obtained by the government in another district of the US

- Hutchins and his legal team will be given a chance to see the government's evidence, albeit within a strict time limit.                "The parties agree that the case should be designated as complex

- Information is still being obtained from multiple sources," the document states.                "The issues are complex

- The defendant requests 45-60 days in which to review the discovery

- The government notes that it is in agreement with the request."                The clock is now ticking

## Cybersecurity world faces 'chronic shortage' of qualified staff

- "The single biggest trend, globally, is that there are chronic work shortages of qualified cyber security staff.

- It's an absolute epidemic," Morgan told supply-chain blog Channelnomics. Morgan's company in 2016 gathered feedback from executives listed highest on the company's list of 500 top cybersecurity firms, many of whom pointed to the same problem. "We are one of the few industries globally experiencing zero-percent unemployment," said Robert Herjavec, CEO of cybersecurity outfit Herjavec Group.

- Until we can rectify the quality of education and training that our new cyberexperts receive, we will continue to be outpaced by the Black Hats.

- Two years ago, another widely cited report from consulting firm Frost  Sullivan warned that there would be a 1.5-million worker shortfall by 2020, and then increased it soon after to 1.8 million. Despite record spending on security  and healthy salaries  nearly half of hiring managers say they are struggling to find cybersecurity staff for open positions, and 62 per cent of them have reported a shortage of information security professionals. So what is the solution? There are a number of organizations, including the Cybersecurity Workforce Alliance (CWA), that are actively trying to recruit more people into the field.

- The CWA was set up by the financial industry, based around New York, to close the skills gap given the importance of cybersecurity to money flows. The new head of the Securities and Exchange Commission, Jay Clayton, is also using his platform to encourage coordination between companies and regulators to share threats as a way of limiting their impact. Morgan argues that the limited degree of specialized education in information technology and computer science around the world is a major factor in the shortage.

## Hardware maker: Give up your privacy and let us record what you say in your home, or well destroy your property

- Hardware maker Sonos has a new privacy policy, and is telling users that unless they agree to it, their devices may cease to function entirely.

- This week, they announced a new privacy policy, where they say theyll be collecting a lot of data about you, including listening in to your room and (in a roundabout way) recording it.

- We dont keep the recordings, we let others do it for us would be a more straightforward wording. As ZDNet notes, the communitys reaction has been quite hostile to the manufacturer who threatens to destroy their property, and not without justification. For my personal purchasing choices, behaving like this is enough to get on my blacklist of manufacturers, just like when Sony willfully infected its customers with rootkit malware in 2005, and Sony made it onto my blacklist.

- He is also the founder of the first Pirate Party and is a political evangelist, traveling around Europe and the world to talk and write about ideas of a sensible information policy.

- Additionally, he has a tech entrepreneur background and loves good whisky and fast motorcycles.

## How Quantum Computing Will Change Browser Encryption

- How Quantum Computing Will Change Browser EncryptionFrom a protocol point of view, we're closer to a large-scale quantum computer than many people think

- Here's why that's an important milestone

- In 2015, The NSAs Information Assurance Directorate issued guidance to postpone moving from RSA cryptography to elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) if they hadnt already done so

- The guidance stated:For those partners and vendors that have not yet made the transition to Suite B elliptic curve algorithms, we recommend not making a significant expenditure to do so at this point but instead to prepare for the upcoming quantum-resistant algorithm transition.The timing of the announcement was curious

- Many in the crypto community wondered if there had been a quantum computing breakthrough significant enough to warrant the NSAs concern

- Since then, the crypto community has been trying to prepare for the transition to quantum-resistant" algorithms  that is, algorithms that are secure against an attack by a quantum computer

- Lets look at some of the likely candidates for those algorithms and how theyll be fitted into the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol that we all use today with HTTPS

- But first, a bit of explanation.If the day ever comes when a real, working, large-scale quantum computer can be built, then the era after that moment will become known as the post-quantum era

## The Boxes That Can Steal Your Social Media and Dropbox Passwords for the Cops

- Just when you thought that surveillance technology couldn't get any more invasive, along comes a device that can steal your social media passwords, grab your emails, siphon your Dropbox contents, and build a detailed profile of your digital life, if your phone is close enough to it

- That's the promise made by "InterApp" a small black-and-white box that targets smartphones, offered by Rayzone Group, a surveillance company from Israel

- Rayzone Group calls the product an "Apps and Cloud Interception System." Forbes was the first to mention the product in a recent article detailing a surveillance trade show in Paris in November

- Motherboard found brochures for InterApp, as well as Rayzone Group's other products, online (embedded below)

- The product brochure says that InterApp "does not require any cooperation from the phone owner

- The only required condition is that the WIFI transmitter of the mobile device will be open (No need to surf the web)."In short, Rayzone Group's website claims that an InterApp device is able to steal the data of "any phone user" within its proximity.InterApp is marketed to intelligence and law enforcement agenciesThe box can apparently pinch data from a number of different smartphone models (a screenshot of an iPhone is included in the brochure, but no mention of specific brands is made), and purports to be able to steal a treasure trove of information from a device: email addresses, passwords and content, social media passwords, the contents of a target's Dropbox, their previous locations, contact list, photos, internet browsing history, and more technical details such as the device's MAC address, model, and operating system

- InterApp is marketed to intelligence and law enforcement agencies, and has similarities to an IMSI catchera device that can obtain certain details about a person's phone, calls and text messages in a local area, and which are often deployed at crowded areas or protests

- InterApp instead focuses on data such as passwords and photos

## Extracting TREZOR secrets from SRAM

- You may want to read the official report: Fixing physical memory access issue in TREZOR.

- Some might argue that generic MCUs are not secure enough for a device like a hardware wallet and there are generally two accepted solutions.

-  I love open source and hacking, and I find the Secure Element contrary to this.

- A quick grep of the TREZOR firmware revealed that software resets are not used at all which meant I would have to resort to hardware resets.

- After utter despair at my lack of hardware knowledge, I finally found the RST pin.

## Security Scenario Generator (SecGen)

- SummarySecGen creates vulnerable virtual machines so students can learn security penetration testing techniques.Boxes like Metasploitable2 are always the same, this project uses Vagrant, Puppet, and Ruby to quickly create randomly vulnerable virtual machines that can be used for learning or for hosting CTF events.The latest version is available at: http://github.com/cliffe/SecGen/IntroductionComputer security students benefit from engaging in hacking challenges

- Practical lab work and pre-configured hacking challenges are common practice both in security education and also as a pastime for security-minded individuals

- Competitive hacking challenges, such as capture the flag (CTF) competitions have become a mainstay at industry conferences and are the focus of large online communities

- Virtual machines (VMs) provide an effective way of sharing targets for hacking, and can be designed in order to test the skills of the attacker

- Websites such as Vulnhub host pre-configured hacking challenge VMs and are a valuable resource for those learning and advancing their skills in computer security

- However, developing these hacking challenges is time consuming, and once created, essentially static

- That is, once the challenge has been "solved" there is no remaining challenge for the student, and if the challenge is created for a competition or assessment, the challenge cannot be reused without risking plagiarism, and collusion.Security Scenario Generator (SecGen) generates randomised vulnerable systems

- VMs are created based on a scenario specification, which describes the constraints and properties of the VMs to be created

## iPhone Secure Enclave Firmware Key Found

-     Earlier today, it was reported that a hacker/researcher called xerub had released the encryption key, and tools to use it, for the firmware that runs the Secure Enclave Processor (SEP) on iPhone 5S

- Reporting was...breathless

- Stories suggested that this move was destroying key piece of iOS mobile security, and that we should be on the lookout for Touch ID hacks and password harvesting scams.Is it really that bad? No, not really.Some of the articles have been improved (slightly) with additional information from xerub and anonymous sources at Apple, but I thought itd be a good idea to review this at a more technical level

- Ive written about the SEP before, especially here and here, so I wont get too deep into the weeds

- Another excellent reference is the regularly-updated iOS Security document produced by Apple

- As I write this, I hope to keep it short, but make no promises.Firmware BasicsFirst, what exactly is this were talking about? The iPhone has many different elements that together make up the firmware for the device

- The overall firmware package includes the root filesystem (the actual unix system that the phone runs), update and restore ramdisks (used, predictably, when updating the phone or restoring from backup), multiple levels of boot code, recovery firmware, and finally, the firmware for the Secure Enclave.Each release of the OS is tailored to individual devices  the firmware for iPhone 5S is different from that for iPhone 6 and iPhone 6S

- Also, each element of the firmware release may be individually encrypted, with a cryptographic IV and 256-bit AES key

## Malware Encoded in DNA Can Hack Gene-Sequencing Software

- But one group of biohackers has demonstrated how DNA can carry a less expected threatone designed to infect not humans nor animals but computers.In new research they plan to present at the USENIX Security conference on Thursday, a group of researchers from the University of Washington has shown for the first time that its possible to encode malicious software into physical strands of DNA, so that when a gene sequencer analyzes it the resulting data becomes a program that corrupts gene-sequencing software and takes control of the underlying computer.

- While that attack is far from practical for any real spy or criminal, it's one the researchers argue could become more likely over time, as DNA sequencing becomes more commonplace, powerful, and performed by third-party services on sensitive computer systems.

- That means when youre looking at the security of computational biology systems, youre not only thinking about the network connectivity and the USB drive and the user at the keyboard but also the information stored in the DNA theyre sequencing.

- That shows, the researchers say, that a future hacker might be able to pull off the attack in a more realistic setting, particularly as more powerful gene sequencers start analyzing larger chunks of data that could better preserve an exploit's code.Needless to say, any possible DNA-based hacking is years away.

- That storage method, while mostly theoretical for now, could someday allow data to be kept for hundreds of years, thanks to DNA's ability to maintain its structure far longer than magnetic encoding in flash memory or on a hard drive.

## Everyone Should Have a Real Chance to Defend Their Anonymity

- UPDATE (August 10, 2017): The court hearing the case ordered [.pdf] the unsealing of EFF's letter brief, which you can read here [.pdf]

- Because the case is entirely under seal, EFF had to file its brief under seal and could not immediately publish the letter

- In the United States, everyone  even people accused of offensive conduct  has the right to communicate anonymously, and that right should never be infringed without due process

- Our Constitution guarantees this, whether your speech is popular or distasteful

- At the same time, people who have been harmed by an anonymous speaker also have a right to seek justice, and, where necessary, that process can include unmasking the speaker.Following a rash of bogus defamation lawsuits designed primarily to unmask anonymous online speakers and retaliate against them, courts around the country adopted legal tests to determine when people suing anonymous speakers are entitled to unmask them

- Recognizing the First Amendment interests at stake, these tests require plaintiffs to establish the legitimacy of their claims and their need for the information.But as we explained in a letter brief filed today in a New York state court, those tests mean little if they are not applied rigorously, and if the speaker in question doesn't have a chance to raise the issue at all

- (The brief is currently under seal, but watch this space  we'll be asking the court to unseal it promptly).Unfortunately, that's precisely what is about to happen to almost 300 Tumblr users who reblogged a sexually explicit video of a 17-year-old girl created 10 years ago

- The person in the video (suing as Jane Doe) thought it had been destroyed, but she recently discovered it had been posted on Tumblr and then reblogged hundreds of times

## Debian move marks beginning of the end for TLS 1.0 and 1.1

- byDo you use the internet? Of course you do

- Whether youre at your PC or reading this on your mobile device, youre using the internet right now

- Transport Layer Security, the successor to Secure Sockets Layer, encrypts many of the internet protocols we use every day

- Whenever you send sensitive data such as authentication credentials or credit card information over the web, youd better see HTTPS in your address bar

- In fact, more and more websites are being completely delivered over HTTPS, even when youre just reading the news

- Hopefully soon the entire web will be on port 443, the default for HTTPS, exclusively

- TLS is also used for internet services such as email, FTP and VPN.Although TLS encrypts internet traffic to improve our cybersecurity, its far from perfect

- Remember Heartbleed, back in 2014? A simple syntax error made most versions of OpenSSL 1.0.1, a TLS implementation, completely useless for encryption

## HBO Game Of Thrones leak: Four 'techies' arrested in India

- Four arrests connected with the leak of an unaired Game of Thrones episode have been made in India. Star India Private Limited, a HBO distribution partner owned by 21st Century Fox, said on Tuesday that local police had arrested four workers associated with its technology vendor, Prime Focus Technologies, apparently in connection the GoT leak. A stolen episode from the current seventh series of the hugely popular show leaked online on 4 August, three days before its official worldwide debut. This is the first time in the history of Star India that an incident of this nature has occurred.

- We are deeply grateful to the police for their swift and prompt action, the media firm said.

- We believe that valuable intellectual property is a critical part of the development of the creative industry and strict enforcement of the law is essential to protecting it. We at Star India  Novi Digital Entertainment Private Limited stand committed  ready to help the law enforcement agencies with any technical assistance and help they may require in taking the investigation to its logical conclusion, it added. HBO last month confirmed that it had suffered a cyberattack that may have compromised a Game of Thrones script and other programming materials.

- However, the leak of the fourth episode online was not part of that hack and related to a separate incident focused on India. In an earlier statement released in the immediate wake of the leak, Star India said: We take this breach very seriously and have immediately initiated forensic investigations at our and the technology partners end to swiftly determine the cause.

- This is a grave issue and we are taking appropriate legal remedial action. The Indian Express reports that three of the four people arrested worked for Prime Focus Technologies, which hosts episodes offered through Star Indias streaming service Hotstar.

## Trump Makes US Cyber Command an Official Combat Arm

- Elevation will also ensure that critical cyberspace operations are adequately funded," President Donald Trump said in an a statement announcing the anticipated move. The White House announcement also noted that Defense Secretary James Mattis is exploring whether to separate the US Cyber Command from NSA.

- As the Department of Defense (DoD) moves to implement the president's order, what is really important in this process is the determination of how to segregate the intelligence mission of the National Security Agency (NSA) from the operational mission of US Cyber Command," he said in a statement. "From my perch, I believe the DoD should not dual-hat the leadership of the two organizations.

- I believe the NSA should be supporting all combatant commands rather than being distracted by trying to be one itself," said Touhill, who is president of Cyxtera's Federal Group.

## Hash of the Titan: How Google bakes security all the way into silicon

-                                 Google has unveiled more details about how security built into its custom silicon chips underpins the integrity of its servers and cloud-based services.                A blog post details how Google's custom Titan chip provides a hardware-verified boot and end-to-end authenticated root of trust for the internet giant's computing workhorses.                "We harden our architecture at multiple layers, with components that include Google-designed hardware, a Google-controlled firmware stack, Google-curated OS images, a Google-hardened hypervisor, as well as data center physical security and services," the team of senior Google techies explain.                Titan is a secure, low-power micro-controller specially designed with Google hardware security requirements which was first announced at Google Cloud Next '17 back in March.                The chip is a continuation of a longer running security philosophy involving building security in custom silicon for Google servers previously covered by The Register back in January.                Titan is designed to ensure a machine boots from a known good state using verifiable code, providing a secure foundation for subsequent operations and all but eliminating the possibility of firmware-based rootkits or other similar nasties.                "Our [data center] machines boot a known firmware/software stack, cryptographically verify this stack and then gain (or fail to gain) access to resources on our network based on the status of that verification

- Titan integrates with this process and offers additional layers of protection," the Google team writes.                Secure boot typically relies on a combination of an authenticated boot firmware and boot loader along with digitally signed boot files

- In addition, a secure element can provide private key storage and management

- Titan then offers two extra security controls  remediation and first-instruction integrity.                Remediation offers a way to re-establish trust in cases where bugs in Titan firmware are found and patched

- First-instruction integrity allows Google to identify the earliest code that runs on each machine's startup cycle.                Titan bundles several components: a secure application processor, a cryptographic co-processor, a hardware random number generator, a key hierarchy, embedded static RAM (SRAM), embedded flash and a read-only memory block.                In effect, Google is pushing verification of secure boot for its hardware all the way down the stack and onto bare-metal silicon

- Google is taking a belt, braces and elasticated waistband approach to delivering secure boot  and it's relying on in-house expertise rather than third parties to deliver this technology.                "[It's] clearly worried about supply chain," University of York techie Arthur Clune suggests.                As Clune notes, the recent Black Hat conference in Las Vegas research on firmware vulnerabilities (PDF) might be used to plant software backdoors

- Google acknowledges such outside interference as a risk it is trying to exclude.                Google designed Titan's hardware logic in-house to reduce the chances of hardware backdoors

- The Titan ecosystem ensures that production infrastructure boots securely using authorized and verifiable code.                The custom Titan chip and how it fits inside Google's purpose-built server [source: Google]                In addition to enabling secure boot, Google has developed an end-to-end cryptographic identity system based on Titan that offers a root of trust for varied cryptographic operations in its data centers

## DreamHost smashed in DDoS attack: Who's to blame? Take a guess...

- Web hosting biz DreamHost has been largely crippled today by a distributed denial of service attack, bringing down most of its services. The assault began at around 0920 PDT (1620 UTC) and quickly overwhelmed the company's systems, particularly its DNS servers.

- DreamHost's status page reports serious disruption to its hosting, webmail and virtual private servers, as well as degraded email performance.  We are beginning to mitigate the attack and will update this post as new information becomes available.

- The warrant also demanded the contact information, submitted comments, email content, and photos of thousands of people who used the site. The company told the DoJ to bugger off  in polite legal terms  and announced it would fight the case.

- On Wednesday, the DoJ backed down and said it wouldn't demand all those IP addresses after all, but still wants some data on protestors. So maybe DreamHost is under attack from the alt-right and their supporters, both in the US and overseas?

- This is a reboot of the neo-Nazi-slash-white-supremacist Daily Stormer website that was dropped like a rabid porcupine by the tech world after the death of a protester at the Charlottesville demonstrations. This makes it likely that the attack is coming from those trying to take the foul neo-Nazi site down, but they are out of luck because DreamHost no longer hosts the Punished Stormer site.

## Brazilians waxed: Uni's Tor relay node booted after harvesting .onions  The Register

- A university research project in Brazil has had its Tor relay node banned after it was caught harvesting the .onion addresses of visitors. Marcus Rodrigues, a junior researcher with the University of Campinas in Sao Paulo, claims he and others were working to create a tool that could tell malicious hidden services from benign ones when they decided to begin poking .onion addresses and fetching their webpages in bulk. "My research in particular is about malicious hidden services.

- I'm developing a method to automatically categorize a malicious hidden service by its content (eg, drug traffic website, malware propagation)," Rodrigues told The Register. "We would then publish an academic paper containing up-to-date statistics regarding what kind of malicious websites there are on the dark web.

- We were also going to develop a platform on which the user could verify if a certain .onion website is trustworthy or malicious before entering it.

- " To do this, Rodrigues says, he modified the node to collect specific data about the hidden services, though he notes nothing was collected that could de-anonymize the user or the specific service. "That would provide information about the Hidden Services running at the time, such as their .onion addresses, their popularity and some technical data  none of which would allow me to deanonymize or harm the hidden service in any way," he explained. In a Tor mailing list post on Thursday, Rodrigues described the system in more detail: 

- In addition, we would never target specific harvested HS, but only a random sample.  Unfortunately, as Tor administrators pointed out, harvesting addresses is a violation of the Tor Project's ethical guidelines and, once caught, the university's node was banned. The moral of the story: always read the rules. Now, Rodrigues says, his group is unable to bring its Tor relay node back online, and so far nobody from the project has given them any indication that the ban will ever be removed.

## Librem 5  A Security and Privacy Focused Phone  Purism

- Not only is it a great win for users now having full control over their devices and their privacy, but it also enables the community to develop on a smartphone platform without restrictions, which opens the door for novel ideas and innovation on these devices.  Matthias Klumpp I trust freedoms governed by democratic transparent power structures.

- Now, I refuse to buy another phone that I do not control and am not the owner of.  Francois Techene, Director of Creative Purism has been doing genuine and important work around making truly free yet desirable laptops.

- While pulling this off is hard, Todd seems like someone who sincerely cares about these issues and has a great track record executing, I think the efforts of Purism deserve the support of the free software community.  Alberto Ruiz, GNOME  Fedora Laptop Enablement

- After Shipment After the Librem 5 ships to customers, we will continue to improve the software by adding common and requested applications such as calendar, notes, calculator, pdf viewer, etc.

- However the free software community is encouraged to test, port, author, and get involved to take all the great free software applications that exist already and make it work on a 5 screen. Will I be able to open word or excel documents sent via email? At delivery we do not plan to support the reader or renderer for these proprietary formats, but this is a top priority to solve after product delivery. Will there be hardware kill switches? Yes, we need to evaluate the wiring and design limitations to determine the best approach; the intention is to include Camera, Microphone, WiFi/Bluetooth, and Baseband Modem kill switches or some combination.

## Bypassing VirtualBox Process Hardening on Windows

- On Windows instead of SUID binaries the VBOX driver uses kernel APIs to try to stop users and administrators opening protected processes and injecting code.

- While an administrator cant bypass the security on opening the process, they can install a local machine Trusted Root CA certificate and sign a DLL, set its owner and force it to be loaded.

-  While its not surprising that it wasnt as simple as just specifying our own DLL (and dont forget we cheated with setting the Owner) it at least gives us hope as this result means the VBOX process will use our hijacked COM registration.

-  In Windows theres usually a clear separation between Kernel32 code, which tends to deal with the many weird behaviors Win32 has built up over the years and the clean NT layer exposed by the kernel through NTDLL.

- However in this case its returning 22900, which as VBOX is treating any result = 0 as success the hardening code gets confused and assumes that the file is valid.

## Ropemaker Allows Attackers to Change the Content of an EmailAfter It's Delivered

- A new email exploit, dubbed Ropemaker, allows a malicious actor to edit the content in an emailafter its been delivered to the recipient and made it through the necessary filters.

- The origin of Ropemaker lies at the intersection of email and Web technologies, more specifically Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) used with HTML, explained Matthew Gardiner, a spokesperson at Mimecast, in a blog.

- While the use of these web technologies has made email more visually attractive and dynamic relative to its purely text-based predecessor, this has also introduced an exploitable attack vector for email.

- Brian Robison, senior director of security technology at Cylance, said that there are aspects of the threat that are not necessarily new, but should nonetheless be on the radar for any organization.

- He added, Phishing emails have been taking advantage of this for some time, including linking to the original source to make it look more legit.

## Dark Web drug network operated from gated community in Altadena, feds say

- A group of Southern Californians have been accused of operating a multimillion-dollar drug distribution network on the dark web from a gated community in Altadena, federal prosecutors said.In an indictment unsealed in the Eastern District of California on Thursday, authorities charged William James Farber, 37, and Bryan Antony Lemons, 29, both of Los Angeles, with conspiracy to possess and distribute a controlled substance and conspiracy to launder money.Also charged with conspiracy to possess and distribute controlled substances were Richard Thomas Martinsen, 29, of Studio City; Michael Angelo Palma, 22, of Los Angeles; Michele Pickerell, 47, of Altadena; and Faysal Mustafa Alkhayat, 31, of Woodland Hills.According to investigators, the group ran two underground drug distribution businesses.

-  The Bitcoin then was exchanged for cash through intermediaries, the criminal complaint said, including through an MIT student who told the Boston Globe in 2013 that the problem with the currency was its reputation with the black market economy.The defendants would make cash deposits in a main bank account in amounts under $10,000 to avoid federal reporting requirements and then withdraw money the same day in smaller amounts from other bank locations, officials said.Investigators painstaking work to identify the conspirators and build a criminal case was outlined in court documents.In 2014, DEA agents discovered a clandestine drug lab in Cambridge, Mass., where dozens of U.S.

- Upon his return, agents had Homeland Security personnel search his cellphone, where they found pictures of him and his girlfriend with various drugs.

- The return address on the drug shipment was fake, and the package was dropped off at the Post Office discreetly in the back of the business.It took months of Postal Service workers recognizing familiar labels on similar packages, reviews of security camera footage and surveillance by authorities to identify the package deliverers were Palma and Martinsen and eventually to cement their connection to PureFireMeds and HumboldtFarms, the complaint said.Farber also appeared to be operating a marijuana grow house out of Northridge, where Department of Water and Power officials told investigators that the building had been using nearly twice as much energy as a Costco, according to the complaint.

- Records showed several of them purchased the shipping labels that were used on the drug shipments while others were linked to the network through property and phone records.If convicted, all six face up to 45 years in prison and $5 million in fines.

## LinkedIn told it cannot stop the bots

- The row began in May when LinkedIn sent HiQ Labs a cease and desist letter demanding it stop trawling LinkedIns public profiles for data - something that takes place, according to HiQs website, roughly every two weeks.

- HiQ Labs offers what it describes as "a crystal ball that helps you determine skills gaps or turnover risks months ahead of time, and a platform that shows you how and where to focus your efforts.

- LinkedIn, which is owned by Microsoft, said using its data in this way - to predict when staff might leave - was a breach of the sites terms of service and also potentially of the US Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA).

- But HiQ Labs, via a special section of its site set up to discuss the case, has dismissed LinkedIns claims of abuse.

- Decades-old lawJudge Edward Chen knocked back LinkedIns complaints, citing concerns about restrictions on a free and open internet.

-                   Enlarge / One of the ads displayed by a fraudulently updated version of the Web Developer extension for Chrome.dviate    Twice in five days, developers of Chrome browser extensions have lost control of their code after unidentified attackers compromised the Google Chrome Web Store accounts used to issue updates.The most recent case happened Wednesday to Chris Pederick, creator of the Web Developer extension

- Last Friday, developers of Copyfish, a browser extension that performs optical character recognition, also had their account hijacked.In both cases, the attackers used the unauthorized access to publish fraudulent updates that by default are automatically pushed to all Chrome users who have the extensions installed

- The tainted extensions were also available for download in Google's official Chrome Web Store

- Both Pederick and the Copyfish developers said the fraudulent updates did nothing more than inject ads into the sites users visited

- The Copyfish developers provided this account that provided a side-by-side comparison of the legitimate and altered code

- Pederick has so far not provided documentation of the changes that were pushed out to the more than one million browsers that have downloaded the Web Developer extension.Converting a useful browser extension into adware is generally little more than an annoyance

- Still, the incidents underscore a serious weakness in Chrome, which is widely regarded among security professionals as the safest browser to use

- Previous abuse of the Google Chrome Web Store shows that criminals who can modify legitimate extension code can use that capability to take control of social media accounts, execute malicious code, and collect browsing histories and user data

- It integrated 18650 charging system, OLED display and three buttons.It is a device which performs a death attack.You select the clients you want to disconnect from their network and start the attack

- As long as the attack is running, the selected devices are unable to connect to their network.Other attacks also have been implemented, such as beacon or probe request flooding.Why did you make it?I designed this development board for spacehuhn's great project: esp8266_deautherIt has already been authorized by spacehuhn.Thanks to the feedback of customers

- I will keep improving this board.How it worksThe 802.11 Wi-Fi protocol contains a so called de-authentication frame

- It is used to disconnect clients safely from a wireless network.Because these management packets are unencrypted, you just need the mac address of the Wi-Fi router and of the client device which you want to disconnect from the network

- You dont need to be in the network or know the password, its enough to be in its range.DisclaimerUse it only for testing purposes on your own devices!I don't take any responsibility for what you do with this program.Please check the legal regulations in your country before using it

- What it does, how it works and how to protect against it is described on the GitHub page (link above).What makes it special?V2 will include an 8dB antenna and an acrylic case

## AMD Threadripper 1950X review: Better than Intel in almost every way

- If Ryzen was a polite, if firm way of telling the world that AMD is back in the processor game, then Threadripper is a foul-mouthed, middle-finger-waving, kick-in-the-crotch "screw you" aimed squarely at the usurious heart of Intel.

- Taken as a whole, there really is no competitionThreadripper is the High End Desktop (HEDT) platform to beat. Double trouble When AMD unveiled its Zen architecture, which finally morphed into a product as Ryzen, much was said about Infinity Fabric, the company's new interconnect designed for maximum scalability.

- They can both boost as far as 4.2GHz across the same four cores thanks to AMD's XFR (extended frequency range) enhancements, which offer increased clock speeds for those with suitably robust cooling setups.

- Then there's the onboard Intel I211-AT gigabit Ethernet; a 10 gigabit Ethernet PCIe expansion card; dual eight-pin power connectors for overclocking the CPU; numerous pump headers, a monoblock sensor and LN2 mode switches for extreme overclocking; a switch for turning individual PCIe lanes on and off (handy for when a card dies in a hardline liquid cooling setup); a customisable OLED display that shows detailed diagnostics during boot, and information like CPU temperature or clock speed when booted (or animated GIFs); and active VRM cooling with a finned heatsink and fan (take that, X299 VRM throttling). There's even a hefty backplate that covers a good third of the rear of the motherboard, complete with built-in RGB lighting that lets you go full boy racer with a neon under glow.

- At stock clocks, the average voltage for the 1950X under load is around 1.12v, resulting in a total system power draw (that includes a GTX 1080 Ti) from the wall of 451W running Asus' Rog Real Bench, and a CPU temperature of 64 degrees Celsius.

## Hotspot Shield VPN Accused of Breaking Privacy Promises

- The tool, produced by Hotspot Shield, has managed to attract around 500 million customers from around the world with promises of anonymous browsing and claims that it keeps no logs of your online activity or personal information.

- However, its own privacy policy reveals that the VPN logs user connection data to identify [a users] general location, improve the Service, or optimize advertisements displayed through the Service, the filing states.

- Hotspot Shield Free VPN claims to clear any browsing info after each session, but it actually deploys persistent cookies and concedes that it works with unaffiliated entities to customize advertising and marketing messages, the FTC filing continues.

- CDTs research was aided by Carnegie Mellon Universitys Mobile App Compliance System, which it claims found undisclosed data sharing practices with third party advertising networks.

- This could be because the app doesnt transmit mobile carrier information through an HTTPS connection, rendering it susceptible to leaks or attacks from malicious third parties, the FTC complaint alleges.

## New NIST draft embeds privacy into US govt security for the first time

-                                 A draft of new IT security measures by the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has for the first time pulled privacy into its core text as well as expanded its scope to include the internet of things and smart home technology.                The proposed "Security and Privacy Controls for Information Systems and Organizations" will be the go-to set of standards and guidelines for US federal agencies and acts as a baseline for broader industry

- As such, it has a huge impact on how technology is used and implemented across America.                This version of the document  its fifth draft  concerns itself with edge computing: the rapidly expanding world of interconnected systems and devices that continue to be added to IT systems and the broader internet.                The foreword to this draft references the "sobering assessment" of the Task Force on Cyber Defense earlier this year on the risk that all these new devices and systems represent to critical infrastructure.                "The cyber threat to US critical infrastructure is outpacing efforts to reduce pervasive vulnerabilities," that report noted, "so that for the next decade at least the United States must lean significantly on deterrence to address the cyber threat... It is clear that a more proactive and systematic approach to U.S

- cyber deterrence is urgently needed."                As such, NIST has attempted to do just that and be proactive in pushing a "systemic approach" and as a result has decided it needs to cover the new reality of everything from the internet of things (IoT) to mobile devices to things like Amazon's Alexa digital assistant (although no actual products get name-checked).                  Privacy                With so many of these powerful computing devices now in the hands of millions of private citizens, that review has inevitably led NIST to consider privacy implications and for the first time privacy has gone from being an appendix to being pulled into the main body of the document.                "The ultimate objective is to make the information systems we depend on more penetration resistant to attacks; limit the damage from attacks when they occur; and make the systems resilient and survivable," the document states.                Another interesting side effect of the new focus is that NIST has stopped pretending that it is only influencing federal agencies (all federal agencies will now be required to follow this NIST guidance following executive action by President Trump) and is actively pitching its contents to private enterprise in the hope of building a more resilient overall network.                Major changes include:                A focus on improved outcomes rather than a general security overviewFully integrating privacy controls into security controls and spending more time digging into the relationship between privacy and securitySeparating the process of selecting of controls from the actual controls  i.e

- allowing organizations other than federal agencies to dip in to the document and grab relevant information without having to wade through irrelevant procurement information (that info has been pushed into a separate document).Greater integration with other risk management and cybersecurity approaches, including the use of common languageUpdated information on systems used to analyze threats and attacks                The addition of privacy concerns is especially stark  the word "privacy" appears more than 2,000 times in the 500-page document

- It contains information on both philosophical and pragmatic approaches to privacy to help sysadmins balance security and privacy concerns.                "Individual privacy cannot be achieved solely through securing personally identifiable information," it notes

- "Consequently, this publication contains controls designed to meet privacy requirements and to manage the privacy risks associated with an organizations creation, collection, use, processing, storage, maintenance, dissemination, disclosure, or disposal of personally identifiable information separate from security concerns."                Among other things, it argues for a specific privacy program and separate privacy-focused training and includes two extensive appendices that track the privacy requirements and considerations for all the different named-and-numbered controls in the document.                It calls for organizations to:                Establish and maintain a comprehensive privacy programEnsure compliance with privacy requirements and manage privacy risksMonitor Federal law, regulation, and policy for changesDesignate a senior agency official for privacy  who is responsible and accountable for the privacy programEnsure coordination between privacy and other programs                Other signs of a more consumer focus is a stress on companies gaining people's consent if any systems gather personally identifiable information  and doing so in plain language so people understand what they are agreeing to.                An example: "When developing or purchasing consent tools, organizations consider the application of good information design procedures in all user-facing consent materials; use of active voice and conversational style; logical sequencing of main points; consistent use of the same word (rather than synonyms) to avoid confusion; the use of bullets, numbers, and formatting where appropriate to aid readability; and legibility of text, such as font style, size, color, and contrast with surrounding background."                Overall, while the document is very long and pretty dense, it is a key document for the network rules that will apply across tens of thousands of different IT systems and in that sense, the greatly expanded consideration of privacy and of devices beyond the traditional servers and laptops approach should bring government guidelines into the modern digital world.                Comments on this draft are due by September 12 and NIST hopes to release a final draft in October with a final version released just before year-end

## DMARC anti-phishing standard adoption is lagging even in big firms

-                                 Big-name companies are still leaving themselves and their customers open to phishing because they haven't implemented the DMARC message validation standard.                In this year's DMARC adoption report [PDF], phishing prevention specialist Agari reckons two-thirds of the Fortune 500 are yet to implement Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting and Conformance (DMARC) yet.                Specified in RFC 7489 to combine Sender Policy Framework and DomainKeys Identified Mail techniques, DMARC's aim is to defeat e-mail spoofing

- It was originally put forward by Google, Microsoft, AOL, Facebook, Yahoo!, PayPal and others.                Agric's data-gathering was straightforward: it analysed the DNS records of its targets  which also included companies on the Financial Times Stock Exchange 100 and the Australian Securities Exchange 100  using its own DMARC record tool.                The FTSE 100 had the same non-adoption rate of 67 per cent, while Australian companies care even less, with 73 per cent having no DMARC policy record.                Even among those who are aware of DMARC, hardly any are using it for anything more than monitoring (25 percent of the Fortune 500, 26 per cent of the FTSE 100, and 23 per cent of the ASX 100).                Quarantine or reject only appeared in eight per cent of Fortune 500 companies, 7 percent of FTSE 100 companies, and four per cent of ASX 100 companies.                Agari reckons that's an open-door to e-mail spoofing, since the point of DMARC is that it both confirms a message came from the server it purports to come from, and creates a register of email systems used by spammers and scammers

- To help things along, back in 2012 Agari made its Receiver Program free to try and encourage adoption.                The IT industry and telcos in particular can hang their heads in shame: apart from 21 per cent of US tech companies using DMARC, and a mere one per cent of US telcos, adoption is zero elsewhere (people, even Twitter thinks it's a good idea).                Deploying a DMARC policy where p=none is simple, but it is only the first step

- Organisations must Quarantine, Reject and maintain strong email governance to reap the benefits of DMARC, the report concludes

## Lottery-hacking sysadmin's unlucky number comes up: 25 years in the slammer

- 

- The lottery sysadmin who fooled around with random numbers has a new variable to consider: how much up to 25 years he'll have to serve of his latest sentence. While working for the Iowa offices of the Multi-State Lottery Association, Eddie Tipton's scam was to rig the lotteries' random number generator so that on certain days, he'd be able to predict the numbers. As we reported in 2015, he tampered with security cameras watching over a lotteries machine, and installed a rootkit that let him run his own code. The scam came unstuck in an investigation over a US$16.5 million winning draw in December 2010, when a gas station CCTV showed a customer, later identified by co-workers as Tipton, bought the winning ticket. His attempts to collect the winnings anonymously brought him to the attention of authorities. In July 2015, he was handed a maximum ten-year sentence for fraud, but that wasn't the end of the matter: prosecutors in several states also chased him on charges of lottery fraud. The Des Moines Register reports a Polk County, Florida, court has added its sentence to Tipton's woes. District Court Judge Brad McCall has given him a maximum 25 years, but his lawyers hope for parole within three or four years. Investigators believe the scam eventually reached to six lotteries in five states, and Tipton was helped by his brother Tommy and a Texas businessman called Robert Rhodes, who was drawn into the investigation in December 2015.

## Did ROPEMAKER just unravel email security? Nah, it's likely a feature

- Microsoft reckons the issue doesn't represent a vulnerability, a stance a third-party security expert quizzed by El Reg backed. Using the ROPEMAKER exploit, a malicious actor can change the displayed content in an email, according to security researchers at Mimecast.

- For example, a hacker could swap a benign URL with a malicious one in an email already delivered to your inbox, or simply edit any text in the body of an email, as illustrated here. The exploit works without direct access to a target's inbox.

- But the security firm has been able to get the trick to work on the most popular email clients and online services.

- As such, the hack is particularly useful for targeted attacks, which might already be taking place under the radar. Matthew Gardiner, cyber resilience expert at Mimecast, said that the firm has shown through testing that email using remote resources (such as a remote CSS) is exploitable. "We can certainly debate whether it is an application vulnerability (thus requiring a patch), an example of the misuse or abuse of an application, or a fundamental design flaw when email and the web were merged," Gardiner said.

- The longer-term fix would involve a revision of internet standards and more intelligent security controls at the network and the endpoint, according to Mimecast.

## Banking trojan-slingers slip past Google Play's malware defences

-                                 Security researchers have uncovered an Android banking malware hiding on Google Play using stealthy new tactics.                A game called "Bubble Shooter Wild Life" and an app named "Earn Real Money Gift Cards" in the Google Play Store are actually designed to drop banking malware named BankBot

- "The malware only becomes active when the actors decide to drop the real trojan on the victim's device and therefore bypassing Google's internal malware scanner named Bouncer," Han Sahin, co-founder of Securify, told El Reg.                Separate research from Zscaler supports Securify's discovery

- The apps are able capable of abusing Android's accessibility permissions to download additional programs without the user's knowledge.                "The malicious apps have been able to conceal themselves by hiding on Google Play and leveraging techniques like time delays and code obfuscation

- At this point, the apps are fairly new to the Play store with fewer than 5,000 downloads

- However, there is a concern around the increase in availability of dubious apps online," Zscaler warns.                El Reg asked Google to comment on the incident, in particular the suggestion that crooks had figured out a way to smuggle malicious code past its security controls, but have not yet received a response.                The latest Android security kerfuffle highlights the need for consumers to be careful about downloading applications, even if they come from the official Google store.                App alerts generated by Google can sometime be wrong

- For example, last weekend OnePlus phones started having Google Play flag a preinstalled system app as malicious

- "GPIO Switch" generated an apparently false alert

- In a response to a thread on its forum, OnePlus said it was chasing the issue

## Phish Bait: DMARC Adoption Failures Leave Companies Exposed

- More than 90% of Fortune 500 companies leave customers and brand names vulnerable to domain name spoofing as a result of not fully implementing DMARC.More than 90% of Fortune 500 companies have not fully adopted Domain-based Message Authentication, Report  Conformance (DMARC), leaving customers, business partners, and brand names exposed to phishing and other attacks that impersonate corporate email domains. DMARC is a standard technology designed to verify whether an email is from the domain it claims to be from.

- It creates a whitelist of verified senders, and ensures only authenticated emails are delivered; fake messages are deleted before users see them.

- It can also be used to see how scammers are misusing corporate information in their attacks. The email verification standard is the product of a 2007 experiment by Yahoo and PayPal to prevent account-credential phishing.

- Industry leaders Bank of America and JP Morgan, both involved in its creation, demonstrated its workability to other businesses and motivated them to use DMARC as well.

## VPN, the mobile 4K ban, and video throttling

-                                                                                                                  Verizons 4K ban is now network-wide

- Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) can be used to bypass video throttling by your internet service provider (ISP) or telecommunication provider

- Since August 23rd, Verizon now throttles all mobile video to 720p and all tablet video to 1080p

- Verizon additionally stated that any provider deemed to be a video service would be throttled to 10 Mbps

- Privacy Online News reported on Verizon Wirelesss video throttling tests earlier this year, noting that a VPN would defeat it when  not if  it was implemented network wide

- Other mobile networks are also implementing similar throttling measures to their unlimited plans

- Because a VPN encrypts your internet traffic and therefore masks its content from your provider, youre able to get the internet speeds that you have paid for.4K ban: Smartphone users on the Verizon network need a VPN to watch 1080p or 4K videoWhether on Android or iOS, if youre on a tablet, youll also need a VPN just to watch 4K video

- While its true that the difference is barely noticeable for most users on average devices nowadays

## CryptoMix Variant Can Communicate Offline

- A ransomware that allows hackers to work offline has been spotted in the wild.The malware is a new variant of CryptoMix, dubbed 'Error', that can add an extension to encrypted files and sets about its work with no network communication.BleepingComputer first uncovered Error, so-called because the extension that it appends reads .ERROR BC and also found that it contains 11 public RSA-1024 encryption keys that will be used to encrypt the AES key that encrypts a victim's files

- This allows the ransomware to work completely offline.While overall the encryption methods stay the same, theres also a new ransom note.As it can run independently, without the need to communicate back to command and control servers, its harder to spot using traditional tools.The real lesson is that cyber-attacks - whether malware, ransomware, or otherwise - are getting more nefarious, said Ken Spinner, vice-president of field engineering at Varonis, via email

- Theyre leveraging new exploits, spreading further and faster, affecting more victims, and causing significant and lasting damage.He added: New variants continue to be introduced at a rapid pace, because its an approach thats working for criminals

- Why reinvent the wheel when minor modifications of existing malware will do? Its a small investment that brings the promise of a big payout.

## Reports of Cuba's Deafening 'Covert Sonic Device' Are Only Getting Stranger

- Image: Amblin EntertainmentThe State Department has remained tight-lipped about the strange circumstances in which US diplomats to Cuba reportedly suffered permanent hearing damage from an inaudible covert sonic device. But new details reveal that a deafeningly loud sound similar to the buzzing created by insects or metal scraping was also used to harass the American envoys

- Whats more, the number of people who were harmed is reportedly even greater than was previously known.What the Hell Is a 'Covert Sonic Device' and Why Is It Deafening Diplomats in Cuba?Russia is a boogeyman once again, and the threat of nuclear war looms in the background of our...Read more According to government sources speaking to CNN on the condition of anonymity, at least 10 US diplomats and family members have been treated for various symptoms following the unexplained attacks that are believed to be part of a concerted harassment campaign

- Five Canadian diplomats and their family members have also experienced some sort of symptoms. From the report:In some of the attacks a sophisticated sonic weapon that operated outside the range of audible sound was deployed either inside or outside the residences of US diplomats living in Havana, according to three US officials.The weapon caused immediate physical sensations including nausea, headaches and hearing loss.Other attacks made a deafeningly loud sound similar to the buzzing created by insects or metal scraping across a floor, but the source of the sound could not be identified, the two US officials said.The additional information that victims heard traditional, irritating sounds within the human hearing range certainly makes the reports of permanent hearing damage more understandable

- And the revelation that family members were also affected makes this all sound more plausible

- But still, if the sound was loud enough to cause damage, how could it possibly be so hard to identify the source? And were any neighbors in the areas that US diplomats were living not also suffering?The fact that the psychological warfare on diplomats reportedly began in the fall of 2016 and remained secret until this month has made everything all the more mysterious

- The New York Times reports that at least six patients were flown from Havana to The University of Miami at an unspecified time this year when a panicked Trump administration could not figure out what was wrong with the victims

- The Times was told that a sonic wave machine was believed to have caused the symptoms which apparently became worse with prolonged exposure

- Sources also claimed that one person had developed a blood disorder.Steve Dorsey from CBS Radio in Washington DC was the first to ask State Department Press Secretary Heather Nauert about the situation when she gave a press conference on August 9th

## Two zero-day vulnerabilities disclosed after Foxit refuses to patch PDF Reader

- 198SHARESShare on FacebookRedditBuffer                                        Researchers have disclosed two zero-day vulnerabilities affecting Foxit's PDF Reader after the vendor revealed it has no plans to fix the security flaws.On 17 August, responsible disclosure program Zero Day Initiative (ZDI) went public with the bugs its researchers found in Foxit's free PDF reader.The first vulnerability (CVE-2017-10951) owes its existence to a lack of proper validation of a user-supplied string before the software's app.launchURL method executes a system call.Foxit PDF Reader's second bug (CVE-2017-10952) also results from improper validation of user-supplied data, but it instead affects the saveAs JavaScript function.When properly exploited, either of the flaws enables a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code.ZDI's Ariele Caltabiano discovered the first flaw back in mid-May 2017, while Steven Seeley of Offensive Security found the second bug near the end of June.Both researchers contacted Foxit about the issues shortly thereafter with the intention of following a 120-day responsible disclosure timeline

- But they ultimately decided to disclose the flaws early after Foxit revealed it had no intention of fixing the bugs.The vendor said as much in a statement provided to AusCERT:"Foxit Reader  PhantomPDF has a Safe Reading Mode which is enabled by default to control the running of JavaScript, which can effectively guard against potential vulnerabilities from unauthorized JavaScript actions."That's all very well, but many of us are all too familiar with attacks which have seen innocent users duped into disabling safety features in order to allow poisonous payloads to execute.Foxit could have used the patches to demonstrate that it takes its products' security seriously and on a timely change

- What a welcome gesture that would have been to Foxit Reader users, especially those who embraced the software while fleeing past Adobe vulnerabilities.I guess it's back to the drawing board for users who aren't running Foxit in Safe Reading mode.For some other non-Adobe PDF readers, check out TechRadar's list

- Just make sure you do your own research if you decide to go with one of these options

- Don't download ANYTHING before you make sure the product has a good security record and will satisfy your needs.Update: Foxit has released a security advisory, and confirmed that it will be issuing a security update to users:"We plan to release a Reader/PhantomPDF 8.3.2 patch update this week (ETA Aug 25th) with additional guard against misuse of powerful (potentially insecure) JavaScript functions  this will make Foxit software equivalent to what Adobe does."More information can be found in Foxit's security bulletin.198SHARESShare on FacebookRedditBuffer

## RETGUARD, the OpenBSD next level in exploit mitigation, is about to debut

-   Contributed by pitrh on 2017-08-20 from the guard my RET, you dept.  In a message to the tech mailling list, Theo de Raadt(deraadt@) offered a preview of the next big thing in exploit mitigation, dubbed RETGUARD:   This year I went to BSDCAN in Ottawa.

- Apparently I told him that I felt return-address protection was impossible, so a few weeks later he sent a clang diff to address that issue... 

-  Over the last two weeks, we have received help and advice to ensure debuggers (gdb, egdb, ddb, lldb) can still handle these transformed callframes.

- Also in the kernel, we discovered we must use a smaller XOR, because otherwise userland addresses are generated, and cannot rely on SMEP as it is really new feature of the architecture.

-  We are at the point where userland and base are fully working without regressions, and the remaining impacts are in a few larger ports which directly access the return address (for a variety of reasons).

## Russian group that hacked DNC used NSA attack code in attack on hotels

-                   EnlargeFireEye        Share this story        A Russian government-sponsored group accused of hacking the Democratic National Committee last year has likely been infecting other targets of interest with the help of a potent Windows exploit developed by, and later stolen from, the National Security Agency, researchers said Friday.Eternal Blue, as the exploit is code-named, is one of scores of advanced NSA attacks that have been released over the past year by a mysterious group calling itself the Shadow Brokers

- It was published in April in the group's most damaging release to date

- Its ability to spread from computer to computer without any user action was the engine that allowed the WCry ransomware worm, which appropriated the leaked exploit, to shut down computers worldwide in May

- Eternal Blue also played a role in the spread of NotPetya, a follow-on worm that caused major disruptions in June.Now, researchers at security firm FireEye say they're moderately confident the Russian hacking group known as Fancy Bear, APT 28, and other names has also used Eternal Blue, this time in a campaign that targeted people of interest as they connected to hotel Wi-Fi networks

- In July, the campaign started using Eternal Blue to spread from computer to computer inside various staff and guest networks, company researchers Lindsay Smith and Ben Read wrote in a blog post

- While the researchers didn't directly observe those attacks being used to infect guest computers connected to the network, they said a related campaign from last year used the control of hotel Wi-Fi services to obtain login credentials from guest devices.In the earlier attack, the APT 28 members used a hacking tool dubbed Responder to monitor and falsify NetBIOS communications passed over the infected networks."Responder masquerades as the sought-out resource and causes the victim computer to send the username and hashed password to the attacker-controlled machine," the FireEye researchers wrote

- "APT 28 used this technique to steal usernames and hashed passwords that allowed escalation of privileges in the victim network." The researchers continued:In the 2016 incident, the victim was compromised after connecting to a hotel Wi-Fi network

- Twelve hours after the victim initially connected to the publicly available Wi-Fi network, APT28 logged into the machine with stolen credentials

## FBI Used Booby-Trapped Video to Catch Suspected Sextortionist Hiding Behind Tor

- On Monday, US authorities announced the arrest of a suspect who used Tor to disguise his online identity and coerce underage female victims into sending sexually explicit images and videos in a tactic commonly referred to as "sextortion."According to court documents, the FBI managed to catch the suspect in June 2017 after it created and deployed a custom NIT (Network Investigative Technique) that relied on appending de-anonymizing code inside a video file.Booby-trapped video leads FBI to California homeFBI agents hosted the file on a Dropbox account shared by the sextortionist and one of his victims, and when the suspect downloaded and opened the file, the code within called back to FBI servers, exposing the alleged crook's real IP address.The IP address led agents back to a Bakersfield, California home, where with a judge's approval they set up video surveillance and used a pen-trap device to intercept the Internet traffic coming and going from the suspect's home.Following weeks of watching the home and the couple living there, agents discovered that whenever the female resident would leave for work, the male resident would connect to the Tor network and carry out covert communications.Suspect's sextortion activity goes back to 2012This and other evidence allowed the FBI to conclude they correctly tracked down the main suspect of a series of sextortion cases that have been going on since 2012, but of which the FBI became aware in December 2015, when one of the victims came forward.According to court documents, the main suspect is a 26-year-old man named Buster Hernandez

- The FBI claims he used a fake online identity named Brian Kil (and others) to reach out to underage girls, some as young as 9 and 12.The suspect would ask if victims were aware that strangers viewed photos of their naked body

- If victims replied affirmatively, the FBI says Hernandez would threaten the victims to send the photos to friends and relatives if they didn't send him new sexually explicit photos and/or videos.Hernandez allegedly went as far as to threaten sextorted victims with physical violence or with murder

- Other messages obtained by the FBI hint that Hernandez  under the Brian Kil persona  made bomb threats and threatened to kill police officers

- The threats led authorities to close down two high schools and one shopping center.Investigators also claim that Hernandez, under another persona, also made fun of investigators for not being able to catch him.Facebook also helped with the investigation

- Below is an image of an undercover FBI agent posing as one of the victims and supplying the booby-trapped video to the Brian Kil persona.Arrested suspect faces between 15 and 30 years imprisonmentInvestigators arrested the suspect earlier this month, and on Monday, they charged him with threats to use an explosive device, threats to injure and sexual exploitation of a child, cyber threats to female victims, and producing child pornography.If found guilty and convicted, Hernandez faces a sentence ranging from 15 to 30 years in prison.The official court documents only include details from three sextorted victims, but investigators believe Hernandez is behind sextortion cases in as many as ten different federal districts

- The FBI is also asking other Brian Kil sextortion victims to step forward, reach out, and file a report.If you believe you have been a victim of sextortion by Buster Hernandez, a/k/a Brian Kil, please contact the Indianapolis FBI Office at https://tips.fbi.gov/ or call 317-595-4000, Option 2, to make a report.In some cases, sextortionists keep the materials they obtain from victims for themselves, but in some cases, some of these images and videos end up on 4chan, Imgur, or specialized Dark Web portals that sell the files for profit

- It is unclear what Hernandez did with the materials he obtained.

## Teen Sold Jewish Center Bomb Threats on Dark Web, FBI Says

- After Israeli police arrested a 19-year-old in March for allegedly hitting dozens of American schools and Jewish centers with bomb threats, the FBI claims the Israeli American teen carried out the attacks for money, the Daily Beast reports.According to unsealed court documents, the FBI is accusing Michael Kadar of running a "School Email Bomb Threat Service" on AlphaBayformerly the world's largest dark web market before the feds shut it down in July.

- Kadar allegedly charged his clients $30 for each threat he phoned in, adding $15 to the cost if the user wanted someone framed for the message, the Atlantic reports.

- Beginning in January, Kadar allegedly phoned in at least 245 threats to schools and Jewish community centers (JCCs) across the country, resulting in scores of evacuations, the Los Angeles Times reports.

- Just hours after the school was evacuated for the phony threat, a note appeared on what the FBI claims is Kadar's AlphaBay page, praising his work as "on time and on target," and celebrating the fact that the school day was cut short.That same day, two nearly identical threats hit the Jewish Community Center of Louisville and the Israeli Embassy in Washington, DC, the Daily Beast reports.According to the Beast, the Israeli police finally caught on to Kadar's buy-a-threat web scheme after he failed to route his internet connection through a proxy server, giving his IP address away.

- When they raided his home in Ashkelon, Israel, on March 23, police reportedly uncovered several computers and a hard drive containing receipts of his alleged deals, suggesting that Kadar ran the entire bomb hoax operation from the comfort of his own bedroom.

## CVE-2016-5696 and its effects on Tor

- tl;dr: This vulnerability is quite serious, but it doesnt affect the Tor network any more than it affects the rest of the internet. In particular, the Tor-specific attacks mentioned in the paper will not work as described.

## Foxit PDF Reader is well and truly foxed up, but vendor won't patch

-                                 Updated The Zero Day Initiative (ZDI) has gone public with a Foxit PDF Reader vulnerability without a fix, because the vendor resisted patching.                The ZDI made the decision last week that the two vulns, CVE-2017-10951 and CVE-2017-10952, warranted release so at least some of Foxit's 400 million users could protect themselves.                In both cases, the only chance at mitigation is to use the software's "Secure Mode" when opening files, something that users might skip in normal circumstances.                CVE-2017-10951 allows the the app.launchURL method to execute a system call from a user-supplied string, with insufficient validation.                CVE-2017-10952 means the saveAs JavaScript function doesn't validate what the user supplies, letting an attacker write "arbitrary files into attacker controlled locations."                Both are restricted to execution with the user's rights.                No fix                ZDI went public after its usual 120-day cycle because the authors made it clear no fix was coming, with this response:                "Foxit Reader  PhantomPDF has a Safe Reading Mode which is enabled by default to control the running of JavaScript, which can effectively guard against potential vulnerabilities from unauthorized JavaScript actions."                Foxit Software appears to be content to suggest users run its wares in Safe Mode, as its security advisories home page offers that advice for bugs identified in 2011.                The company did patch a dirty dozen bugs in 2016

-                 Update: On August 22, Foxit decided mitigation is necessary, as noted here.

## Google Removes 500 Android Apps Following Spyware Scare

- Android apps embedded with an advertising software development kit removed after researchers discover its potential for stealing users' caller data

- Google has eliminated from its Play Store 500 Android apps that in all had been downloaded 100 million times following the discovery of an embedded Chinese advertising software development kit (SDK) that allowed spyware to pilfer users' caller information.Earlier this year, Lookout Security researchers discovered developers were embedding the popular Igexin advertising SDK into their apps without realizing it would remotely download plugins into those apps: one of which was a spyware plugin that would steal caller data, says Christoph Hebeisen, a member of the Lookout Security Intelligence team that made the discovery.Developers typically use SDKs to save time in coding or because they lack the expertise to code it themselves

- The advertising SDKs allow mobile app developers to use advertising networks and deliver ads, which in turn allows the developers to generate revenue from those ads

- Developers, however, often do to audit SDKs for vulnerabilities or malicious software and, more than likely, were not aware of Igexin's spyware plugin, Hebeisen notes.He adds the Igexin case marked the first time an SDK was used as a vector to deliver a malicious payload and he expects attackers to turn to SDKs in due time."It is an interesting vector and something we need to be on the lookout for in the future," he says

- "It is a challenge for an attacker to get a malicious app in Google Play or the App Store

- But an SDK is a way for them to bundle it in with a legitimate app maker and reach a much wider audience."Piggybacking onto a legitimate developer's work is expanding

- XcodeGhost, for example, disguised itself as a complier waiting to be used by developers in their work, Hebeisen says.Unraveling Igexin's SDK Igexin's SDK plugin can pilfer call data, including phone numbers, time of call and whether the call rang, stood idle, or was off the hook, before uploading this information to the Chinese company, Hebeisen says."This was over the line

- It wanted personal data," Hebeisen says, noting that some of the other Igexin plugins requested more benign information like a user's location

## Top Security Firm May Be Leaking 'Terabytes' of Confidential Data From Fortune 100 Companies

- Photo: GettyA leading American security company and purveyor of anti-malware detection services is waking up to a damning report about a massive vulnerability in its flagship product

- The report describes an unimaginable leak, the scope of which covers a wide range of confidential data, including customer credentials and financial records, among other sensitive files.In a blog posted  late Tuesday night, information security firm DirectDefense announced the discovery of inherent flaw in a leading anti-malware product offered by Carbon Black, a US-based company that supplies security products to nearly a third of the the largest 100 public and privately held companies in the United States.The report claims Carbon Blacks product, Cb Response, is responsible for leaking a tremendous amount of data, from cloud keys and app store keys to usernames and passwords and proprietary applications, including custom algorithms and other sensitive trade secrets

- While the leaked data is not generally available online, DirectDefense believes it is accessible to governments, corporations and security teams willing to pay premium for access to pricey anti-malware tools

- The scheme is what DirectDefense President Jim Broome has termed the worlds largest pay-for-play data exfiltration botnet.Originally founded as a company called Bit9, Carbon Black specializes in whats  called endpoint detection and response, or EDR, a term for security tools that detect and investigate suspicious activities on network endpointsmobile devices, laptops, desktop PCs, and so on

- Data collected on potential threats is aggregated into a central location for further analysis to help grow and inform the platforms threat intelligence capabilities.Carbon Black identifies files that are good versus those that are bad to prevent clients from running harmful files on their systems

- This means it relies on whitelisting policies to fend off threats, and its a massive endeavor

- It requires the company to constantly evaluate an enormous and ever-expanding pool of filesanything that an antivirus scanner checks for a potential infection

- The problem, according to the DirectDefense, is that Carbon Black encounters files on its clients computer that it has never seen before

## Replacement Smartphone Components Can Carry Security Vulnerabilities

- A recent paper entitled Shattered Trust by Omer Shwartz, Amir Cohen, Asaf Shabtai and Yossi Oren has emerged

- This paper shows how a replacement touchscreen for a Nexus 6P coupled by exploiting the Synaptics S3718 touchscreen driver led to an ability to entirely control the device via kernel execution

- With one simple idea and a modified replacement screen, the team behind Shattered took over the entire device

- This paper serves as a warning to those who purchase cheap, non-OEM components for their devices.Many of us have probably replaced a screen of a device weve owned at some point in our lives

- I know many people who have smashed their phone, only to replace the screen and the following week smash it again

- Phone screens are fragile, and according to a study from Motorola in 2015, referenced by the paper, about 50% of all smartphone users have at some stage broken their screen.The importance of OEM replacement partsIts important to buy OEM parts, and not just because theyre authentic and guaranteed to work

- With OEM parts, youre receiving the same hardware that would have been built into another phone of the same model and sold in an official store

- Buying fake replacement parts runs the risk of failure and thus wasted money
