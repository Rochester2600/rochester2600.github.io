## Rutkowska: Trust Makes Us Vulnerable

- She says we have too much trust in technology and this trust is leaving us vulnerable to attack. "When I call something 'trusted' I really mean something negative," she continued

> "I don't want things to be trusted." Rutkowska emphasized the differences in calling technology "trusted," "secure," and "trustworthy." When something is secure, it's difficult to penetrate but not necessarily benign: even malicious things suc

- However, the meaning of "good" varies across groups: corporate IT teams, for example, may have different standards than activists

> "Trustworthy is really a very context-specific adjective," she noted. Rutkowska argued that security professionals can - and should - minimize their trust in modern technologies, many of which could put users at risk

- She presented several examples of how current technology leaves users vulnerable and how they could potentially be made secure. As an example, she pointed to persistent laptop compromises

- A laptop's motherboard has several elements and microcontrollers, most of which contain firmware that is kept on persistent, or flash, memory

## Security Vulnerabilities in Certificate Pinning

-  Security Vulnerabilities in Certificate Pinning New research found that many banks offer certificate pinning as a security feature, but fail to authenticate the hostname

- This leaves the systems open to man-in-the-middle attacks. From the paper: Abstract: Certificate verification is a crucial stage in the establis

- A common security flaw in TLS implementations is the lack of certificate hostname verification but, in general, this is easy to detect

- In security-sensitive applications, the usage of certificate pinning is on the rise

- This paper shows that certificate pinning can (and often does) hide the lack of proper hostname verification, enabling MITM attacks

- Dynamic (black-box) detection of this vulnerability would typically require the tester to own a high security certificate from the same issuer (and often same intermediate CA) as the one used by the app

- We present Spinner, a new tool for black-box testing for this vulnerability at scale that does not require purchasing any certificates

- By redirecting traffic to websites which use the relevant certificates and then analysing the (encrypted) network traffic we are able to determine whether the hostname check is correctly done, even in the presence of certificate pinning

## New Android vulnerability allows attackers to modify apps without affecting their signatures

- A serious vulnerability (CVE-2017-13156) in Android allows attackers to modify the code in applications without affecting their signatures

- The root of the problem is that a file can be a valid APK file and a valid DEX file at the same time

- We have named it the Janus vulnerability, after the Roman god of duality.Janus vulnerabilityThe Janus vulnerability stems from the possibility to add extra bytes to APK files and to DEX files

- On the one hand, an APK file is a zip archive, which can contain arbitrary bytes at the start, before its zip entries (actually more generally, between its zip entries)

- The JAR signature scheme only takes into account the zip entries

- It ignores any extra bytes when computing or verifying the application's signature

- On the other hand, a DEX file can contain arbitrary bytes at the end, after the regular sections of strings, classes, method definitions, etc

- A file can, therefore, be a valid APK file and a valid DEX file at the same time. Another key element is a seemingly harmless feature of the Dalvik/

## Nvidia announces $2,999 Titan V, 'the most powerful PC GPU ever created'

-  It seems like Nvidia announces the fastest GPU in history multiple times a year, and thats exactly whats happened again today; the Titan V is the most powerful PC GPU ever created, in Nvidia's words

- It represents a more significant leap than most products that have made that claim, however, as it's the first consumer-grade GPU based around Nvidias new Volta architecture

-  That said, a liberal definition of the word consumer is in order here  the Titan V sells for $2,999 and is focused around AI and scientific simulation processing

- Nvidia claims up to 110 teraflops of performance from its 21.1 billion transistors, with 12GB of HBM2 memory, 5120 CUDA cores, and 640 tensor cores that are said to offer up to 9 times the deep-learning performance of its predecessor

-  Also it comes in gold and black, which looks pretty cool.        Our vision for Volta was to push the outer li

- We broke new ground with its new processor architecture, instructions, numerical formats, memory architecture and processor links, Nvidia founder and CEO Jensen Huang says in a statement

- With Titan V, we are putting Volta into the hands of researchers and scientists all over the world

- I cant wait to see their breakthrough discoveries. Theres no word on when Volta might make its way into more attainable gaming-focused GPUs

## Toucan play that game: Talking toy bird hacked

- Firstly, the Toucan is a Bluetooth audio device

- It has a microphone and speaker, so its possible to simply pair it to a Bluetooth audio device (laptop, phone etc) and play some audio through the Toucan. The Toucan works in a slightly different method to Cayla

- The audio files are .mp3 contained in an OBB

- The second (slightly trickier) hack involves extracting the Android package in the same way as PTP did with the Cayla hack and simply change the mp3 to a sweary one of your choice. The French regulators acted against Cayla earlier this week. Of more concern is that one can use the microphone too

- Each new event that launches a new page or transcends multiple domains inside an individual tab will all be handled by a new process

## TP-Link repeater firmware squanders 715 MB/month

-  You should probably avoid TP-Link products if youre on a tight bandwidth budget

- By design, TP-Link firmware sends six DNS requests and one NTP query every 5 seconds, for a total of 715,4 MB per month. The firmware of some TP-Link repeaters  but not routers  including all 2017 models are

- NTP is the network time protocol used to synchronize clocks across the web

- To put this number in context: an always-on Windows device will use around 1,6 KB per month on NTP. TP-Links firmware doesnt have any sort of DNS caching, and they query DNS about 6 NTP server pool addresses every 5 seconds followed by an NT

- An always-on Windows client sends 1 DNS and 1 NTP request once a week

- (If you power cycle or suspend your device, it will send one additional request.) This means your TP-Link product is using about 1,38 KB every 5 seconds  or 23,85 MBs per day  on timekeeping

- For comparison, a 5-minute check would be considered a pretty aggressive checking interval, and would only consume 11,92 MB per month.

- The vulnerabilities let attackers take full control of any device running Linux, or OS derived from Linux, putting the majority of IoT devices at risk of exposure

- The researchers discussed and demonstrated their latest findings at Black Hat Europe 2017, held last week in London. Vulnerabilities in the Bluetooth stack have been overlooked for the past decade, they explained

- Bluetooth, often perceived as peripheral, could benefit attackers if they successfully break into a high-privilege device

- As the researchers demonstrated, one compromised product can spread its attack over the air to other devices within Bluetooth range. "These attacks don't require any user interaction or any authentication," said Armis head researcher Ben Seri

- Armis experts found 5.3 billion devices at risk and eight vulnerabilities, four of which were classified as critical

- These flaws enable attackers to bypass and break into a device without its owner knowing what happened, he explained. Each vulnerability across the Bluetooth stack is "a testament to the fact that no specific part is vulnerable, but Bluetooth

- In general, these implementations are complex and unexamined. Bluetooth has a large attack surface, Armis researcher Gregory Vishnepolsky said

## Google Sheds Light on Data Encryption Practices

- One focuses on encryption of data in transit; the other on service-to-service communication using Application Layer Transport Security (ALTS). Google gets a lot of questions from customers on how it protects data, says Maya Kaczorowski, Google

- Today's release details the steps taken to protect authenticity, integrity, and privacy by verifying data sources, ensuring data arrives unchanged, and keeping data confidential while in transit. Encryption in transit refers to "how data moves

- When a user sends data to the Google Cloud, it's encrypted in transit by default using HTTPS and TLS

- Both of these are common practice; Google introduces more security for data traveling outside its infrastructure. Google Cloud encrypts and authenticates all data in transit, at multiple network layers, when it moves outside physical boundarie

- Data within these boundaries is authenticated but not always encrypted because strong security measures are already in place. "When running at Google's scale, performance is important," Kaczorowski says

> "Different modes of protection we use depend on the threat model and performance requirements that we have." To protect against potential threats, she continues, Google assumes the external wide-area network "is only semi-trusted." Encrypting

## Apache vs Nginx: Practical Considerations (2015)

-   Introduction Apache and Nginx are the two most common open source web servers in the world

- Together, they are responsible for serving over 50% of traffic on the internet

- Both solutions are capable of handling diverse workloads and working with other software to provide a complete web stack. While Apache and Nginx share many qualities, they should not be thought of as entirely interchangeable

- Each excels in its own way and it is important to understand the situations where you may need to reevaluate your web server of choice

- This article will be devoted to a discussion of how each server stacks up in various areas. General Overview Before we dive into the differences between Apache and Nginx, let's take a quick look at the background of these two projects

- Since the HTTP web server is the foundation's original project and is by far their most popular piece of software, it is often referred to simply as "Apache". The Apache web server has been the most popular server on the internet since 1996

- Because of this popularity, Apache benefits from great documentation and integrated support from other software projects. Apache is often chosen by administrators for its flexibility, power, and widespread support

- It is extensible through a dynamically loadable module system and can process a large number of interpreted languages without connecting out to separate software. Nginx In 2002, Igor Sysoev began work on Nginx as an answer to the C10K

## Big data meets Big Brother as China moves to rate its citizens

-  On June 14, 2014, the State Council of China published an ominous-sounding document called "Planning Outline for the Construction of a Social Credit System"

- In the way of Chinese policy documents, it was a lengthy and rather dry affair, but it contained a radical idea

- What if there was a national trust score that rated the kind of citizen you were?Imagine a world where many of your daily activities were constantly monitored and evaluated: what you buy at the shops and online; where you are at any given time

- It's not hard to picture, because most of that already happens, thanks to all those data-collecting behemoths like Google, Facebook and Instagram or health-tracking apps such as Fitbit

- But now imagine a system where all these behaviours are rated as either positive or negative and distilled into a single number, according to rules set by the government

- That would create your Citizen Score and it would tell everyone whether or not you were trustworthy

- Plus, your rating would be publicly ranked against that of the entire population and used to determine your eligibility for a mortgage or a job, where your children can go to school - or even just your chances of getting a date.A futuristic vi

- The Chinese government is pitching the system as a desirable way to measure and enhance "trust" nationwide and to build a culture of "sincerity"

## XenServer 7.3: Changes to the Free Edition

-  Today we're pleased to announce the release of XenServer 7.3, a raft of new features and improvements

- Whilst you can read all about exactly what's in that release over on the release announcement blog, I wanted to provide clarity on the changes we're maki

- All of them are installed from the same ISO, and all are equally open source

- The Standard edition almost identical to the Free edition in terms of feature set, but includes commercial support and an extended period of hotfix availability from Citrix, whilst the Enterprise edition enables a variety of additional features.

- No features are moving from Free to Enterprise

- You can find all of the details in the full XenServer 7.3 feature matrix. I suspect many readers will be asking "why?"

- We have thousands of customers who trust XenServer to host their workloads, and we need to make sure we can invest in the product for them

- Of the many thousands of customers using the Free edition, we hope that those using it for large deployments (and likely to be using the features above) will consider purchasing a subscription to enable access not just to the features above, but also

- The Windows Hello system has two main parts: there's the physical hardware, which for Hello is a webcam with infrared illumination and detection, and the software algorithms, which are part of Microsoft's Biometric Framework

- With this design, Microsoft can refine and improve the algorithms, and the improvements should work for any compatible hardware. Windows Hello's infrared requirement should protect it from being spoofed by regular photos

- So what the researchers from SySS did was use a photo taken with an infrared camera

- This photo was then adjusted to change its contrast and brightness and printed at a low resolution on a laser printer

- The resulting picture was successful at authenticating a user with Hello on two separate devices: a Surface Pro 4, using its integrated camera, and a laptop, using a discrete LilBit USB camera. While the picture produced this way would not foo

- It appears that it integrates infrared and RGB data, making the infrared-only photo distinguishable from a real human

## Summon by cyberark

-  overview summon is a command-line tool that reads a file in secrets.yml format and injects secrets as environment variables into any process

- Once the process exits, the secrets are gone.    summon is not tied to a particular secrets source

- Instead, sources are implemented as providers that summon calls to fetch values for secrets

- Providers need only satisfy a simple contract and can be written in any language. Running summon looks like this: summon --provider conjur -f secrets.yml chef-client --once ENV['...'] syntax. This same pattern works for any tooling that can access environment variables. As a second example, Docker: summon 

- There are no sensitive values in this file itself

- It can safely be checked into source control

- Given a secrets.yml file, summon fetches the values of the secrets from a provider and provide them as environment variables for a specified process. The format is basic YAML with an optional tag

## 2017 Security Predictions through the Rear Window

-  If you're going to forecast the future, go big

- It's no secret that I've long held a dim view of the security predictions that invariably bombard our feeds and social media accounts every December

- In years past, I made a point to write up an article using a list of predictions from a blog post 10 years earlier

- The catch here was that the list read as an indictment as opposed to a prediction

- Of the list of 10 security issues, eight remained relevant a decade after they were posted. The practice of making predictions often brings to mind the image of a palm reader or medium saying, "I'm seeing a security breach for a company that s

- The protagonist of the film  confined to his apartment in the summer heat  pieces together a crime from the bits and pieces that he sees unfolding in the apartment across the way from his rear window

- This view feels familiar as we talk about security issues in bits and pieces as found in security predictions. If you pull all of the predictions together, they start to paint a more vivid picture of the issues that security practitioners face

- As the end of the year drew closer, I couldn't help but wonder how the palm readers fared with their 2017 proclamations, so I took a sampling of some of the lists that I could find online

## Acoustical Attacks against Hard Drives

-  Acoustical Attacks against Hard Drives Interesting destructive attack: "Acoustic Denial of Service Attacks on HDDs": Abstract: Among storage components, ha

- Such advances in HDDs have made them an inevitable part of numerous computing systems, including, personal computers, closed-circuit television (CCTV) systems, medical bedside monitors, and automated teller machines (ATMs)

- Despite the widespread use of HDDs and their critical role in real-world systems, there exist only a few research studies on the security of HDDs

- In particular, prior research studies have discussed how HDDs can potentially leak critical private information through acoustic or electromagnetic emanations

- Borrowing theoretical principles from acoustics and mechanics, we propose a novel denial-of-service (DoS) attack against HDDs that exploits a physical phenomenon, known as acoustic resonance

- We perform a comprehensive examination of physical characteristics of several HDDs and create acoustic signals that cause significant vibrations in HDDs internal components

- We demonstrate that such vibrations can negatively influence the performance of HDDs embedded in real-world systems

- We show the feasibility of the proposed attack in two real-world case studies, namely, personal computers and CCTVs.

## Siguza/IOHIDeous

-  A macOS kernel exploit based on an IOHIDFamily 0day. Write-up here. Notice The prefetch timing attack I'm using for hid for some reason doesn't work on

- Maybe patched, maybe just the consequence of a random change, I neither know nor care

- The vuln is still there and my code does both info leak and kernel r/w, just not in the same binary - reason is explained in the write-up

- If you want that feature, consider it an exercise for the reader. Usage The exploit consists of three parts:  poc panics the kernel to demonstrate the present of a memory corruption, should work on all macOS v

- Otherwise tries to log you out via AppleScript, and then falls back to wait. wait simply waits for a logout, shutdown or reboot to occur.  Additionally you can specify a second argument persisthid will permanently disable SIP and AMFI, and install a root shell in /System/pwned. leak and hid should be run either via SSH or from a screen session, if you wish to

## 'Kernel memory leaking' Intel processor design flaw forces Linux, Windows redesign  The Register

-  A fundamental design flaw in Intel's processor chips has forced a significant redesign of the Linux and Windows kernels to defang the chip-level security bug. Programmers are scrambling to overhaul the open-source Linux kernel's virtu
