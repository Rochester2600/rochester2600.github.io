## Apache vs Nginx: Practical Considerations (2015)

![lurl](https://media3.giphy.com/media/xohKa5PjpETgk/giphy.gif?cid=e1bb72ff5a4fbb726c2f574b67db610a)

-   Introduction Apache and Nginx are the two most common open source web servers in the world

- Together, they are responsible for serving over 50% of traffic on the internet

- Both solutions are capable of handling diverse workloads and working with other software to provide a complete web stack. While Apache and Nginx share many qualities, they should not be thought of as entirely interchangeable

- Each excels in its own way and it is important to understand the situations where you may need to reevaluate your web server of choice

- This article will be devoted to a discussion of how each server stacks up in various areas. General Overview Before we dive into the differences between Apache and Nginx, let's take a quick look at the background of these two projects

- Since the HTTP web server is the foundation's original project and is by far their most popular piece of software, it is often referred to simply as "Apache". The Apache web server has been the most popular server on the internet since 1996

- Because of this popularity, Apache benefits from great documentation and integrated support from other software projects. Apache is often chosen by administrators for its flexibility, power, and widespread support

- It is extensible through a dynamically loadable module system and can process a large number of interpreted languages without connecting out to separate software. Nginx In 2002, Igor Sysoev began work on Nginx as an answer to the C10K

## The CCC: Men Who Hate Women

-    Tuesday, 26 December 2017   By  In hacking  tags: ccc 

- This post is about people and organisations which havent changed, such as the Chaos Computer Club (CCC), who have attempted to save face in public, while privately working to undermine positive change and enable rapists. In June

- Unlike other organisations  such as The Tor Project, or The Cult of the Dead Cow  the CCC delayed for more than a month in responding

- Eventually, their hand was forced by a parody @chaosupdales Twitter account announcing that the CCC had expelled Jake

- First, the CCC clarified that they had not expelled Jake

- Then, the CCC posted a vague statement that all are welcome

- Finally, the CCC claimed that their statement had, of course, referred to Jake all along

- Of course, they only clarified this on Twitter and never updated their statement

## Big data meets Big Brother as China moves to rate its citizens

![lurl](https://media1.giphy.com/media/3o6fJd6iEkL8Ys7tsY/giphy.gif?cid=e1bb72ff5a4fbb7654754a4f4140e0de)

-  On June 14, 2014, the State Council of China published an ominous-sounding document called "Planning Outline for the Construction of a Social Credit System"

- In the way of Chinese policy documents, it was a lengthy and rather dry affair, but it contained a radical idea

- What if there was a national trust score that rated the kind of citizen you were?Imagine a world where many of your daily activities were constantly monitored and evaluated: what you buy at the shops and online; where you are at any given time

- It's not hard to picture, because most of that already happens, thanks to all those data-collecting behemoths like Google, Facebook and Instagram or health-tracking apps such as Fitbit

- But now imagine a system where all these behaviours are rated as either positive or negative and distilled into a single number, according to rules set by the government

- That would create your Citizen Score and it would tell everyone whether or not you were trustworthy

- Plus, your rating would be publicly ranked against that of the entire population and used to determine your eligibility for a mortgage or a job, where your children can go to school - or even just your chances of getting a date.A futuristic vi

- The Chinese government is pitching the system as a desirable way to measure and enhance "trust" nationwide and to build a culture of "sincerity"

- These cloud computers can be just as vulnerable as any other computer, putting the privacy of sensitive data at risk

- As nation-state cyber weapons become increasingly available to amateur and low-level professional cyber criminals, the external threats against those cloud-based systems continue to grow

- In addition, clouds are controlled by vendors who have intimate access to those machines, creating an insider threat that presents an even greater risk to privacy. But why is privacy at risk here? Surely were all smart enough to encrypt our d

- TLS, among other protocols, takes care of that for us (if we remember to use it)

- Microsoft added an "enhanced anti-spoofing" mode in the Windows 10 Creators Update earlier this year that properly defeats the attack, but it's neither enabled by default nor compatible with all Windows Hello hardware. The obvious question wit

- The Windows Hello system has two main parts: there's the physical hardware, which for Hello is a webcam with infrared illumination and detection, and the software algorithms, which are part of Microsoft's Biometric Framework

- With this design, Microsoft can refine and improve the algorithms, and the improvements should work for any compatible hardware. Windows Hello's infrared requirement should protect it from being spoofed by regular photos

- So what the researchers from SySS did was use a photo taken with an infrared camera

- This photo was then adjusted to change its contrast and brightness and printed at a low resolution on a laser printer

- The resulting picture was successful at authenticating a user with Hello on two separate devices: a Surface Pro 4, using its integrated camera, and a laptop, using a discrete LilBit USB camera. While the picture produced this way would not foo

- It appears that it integrates infrared and RGB data, making the infrared-only photo distinguishable from a real human

- This is the fourth blog in our series of Top 5 interesting cases from 2017

- Each of these bugs has some element that sets them apart from the approximately 1,000 advisories released by the program this year

- Todays post details a bug that allows attackers to escape a virtual guest machine and execute code on the hypervisor.OverviewFor Pwn2Own 2016, we introduced VMware as a new target category in the contest

- Unfortunately, no contestant attempted to escape VMwares isolation that year

- It seems that the inclusion of virtual machine escapes came as a surprise to potential contestants

- However, since we introduced it at Pwn2Own, we started receiving VMware submissions through the Zero Day Initiative program and saw two successful VMware escapes at Pwn2Own 2017.One of the best VMware submissions we received in 2017 was  Did you hear that?For more than a week, students and staff in at least four campus buildings heard a five-second tune, but couldnt pinpoint exactly where it was coming from.Some ignored it

- It was hidden in a light sill in Klarman.But shortly after that device was found and confiscated by Cederstrom, two more popped up in hidden areas in Klarman Hall

- Garcia discovered one disc that produced Astleys song from under a statue in Klarman Hall, and another device seems to be playing the song intermittently from behind a wall in the building.  "Crypto" Is Being Redefined as Cryptocurrencies I agree with Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai, "Cryptocurrencies aren't 'crypto'":[...] To be clear, I'm not the only one who is mad about this

## 2017 Security Predictions through the Rear Window

-  If you're going to forecast the future, go big

- It's no secret that I've long held a dim view of the security predictions that invariably bombard our feeds and social media accounts every December

- In years past, I made a point to write up an article using a list of predictions from a blog post 10 years earlier

- The catch here was that the list read as an indictment as opposed to a prediction

- Of the list of 10 security issues, eight remained relevant a decade after they were posted. The practice of making predictions often brings to mind the image of a palm reader or medium saying, "I'm seeing a security breach for a company that s

- The protagonist of the film  confined to his apartment in the summer heat  pieces together a crime from the bits and pieces that he sees unfolding in the apartment across the way from his rear window

- This view feels familiar as we talk about security issues in bits and pieces as found in security predictions. If you pull all of the predictions together, they start to paint a more vivid picture of the issues that security practitioners face

- As the end of the year drew closer, I couldn't help but wonder how the palm readers fared with their 2017 proclamations, so I took a sampling of some of the lists that I could find online

## Acoustical Attacks against Hard Drives

![lurl](https://media2.giphy.com/media/YSm7VVAZbq2xW/giphy.gif?cid=e1bb72ff5a4fbbb3764c45696f4d038f)

- Despite the widespread use of HDDs and their critical role in real-world systems, there exist only a few research studies on the security of HDDs

- In particular, prior research studies have discussed how HDDs can potentially leak critical private information through acoustic or electromagnetic emanations.

- we propose a novel denial-of-service (DoS) attack against HDDs that exploits a physical phenomenon, known as acoustic resonance.

- We demonstrate that such vibrations can negatively influence the performance of HDDs embedded in real-world systems. We show the feasibility of the proposed attack in two real-world case studies, namely, personal computers and CCTVs.
