## 10 Years Later: FileZilla Adds Support For Master Password That Encrypts Your Logins

- An anonymous reader writes: "Following years of criticism and user requests, the FileZilla FTP client is finally adding support for a master password that will act as a key for storing FTP login credentials in an encrypted format," reports BleepingComputer.

- "This feature is scheduled to arrive in FileZilla 3.26.0, but you can use it now if you download the 3.26.0 (unstable) release candidate from here."

- By encrypting its saved FTP logins, FileZilla will finally thwart malware that scrapes the sitemanager.xml file and steals FTP credentials, which were previously stolen in plain text.

- All their requests have fallen on deaf ears and met with refusal from FileZilla maintainer, Tim Kosse.

- In November 2016, a user frustrated with Koose's stance forked the FileZilla FTP client and added support for a master password via a spin-off app called FileZilla Secure.

## Last week: 'OpenVPN client is secure!' This week: 'Unpatched bug in OpenVPN server'

-                                 French security outfit Sysdream has gone public with a vulnerability in the admin interface for OpenVPN's server.                The finding is a bit awkward because it comes after OpenVPN's client got a clean bill of health in two independent security audits earlier this month.                The attack, designated CVE-2017-5868, was published by Sysdream's Julien Boulet 90 days after the company says OpenVPN first acknowledged the issue.                While waiting for a fix, this OSS-SEC post suggests users put a reverse proxy between the server and the Internet, and restrict access to the Web interface.                The server's mistake is that it doesn't escape the carriage return/line feed (CR/LF) character combination

- Exploiting these vulnerabilities, we were able to steal a session from a victim and then access the application (OpenVPN-AS) with his rights. the post says, adding that there are serious consequences if the victim is an administrator account.                By opening the OpenVPN-AS application, the victim receives a valid session cookie pre-authentication

- That session cookie can be set by the attacker using a malicious URL; and when the victim completes login, their profile and rights will be associated with the attacker's cookie.                In fairness, The Register notes that for such popular software with a big attack surface, OpenVPN has a fairly low turnover of security vulnerabilities

-

## Massive vulnerability in Windows Defender leaves most Windows PCs vulnerable

- Microsoft on Monday patched a severe code-execution vulnerability in the malware protection engine that is used in almost every recent version of Windows (7, 8, 8.1, 10, and Server 2016), just three days after it came to its attention.

- He called it "the worst Windows remote code exec in recent memory" and warned that an attacks "work against a default install, don't need to be on the same LAN, and it's wormable."

- To their surprise, Microsoft pushed out the patch Monday evening. Because MsMpEng runs at the highest privilege level and is so ubiquitous across Windows PCs, this vulnerability is about as bad as it gets.

- NScript isn't sandboxed and runs at a very high privilege level, and it's used to evaluate untrusted code by default on almost every modern Windows system.

- "This is as surprising as it sounds," the bug report says. NScript can be exploited with a few lines of JavaScript, which can be injected via a specially crafted Web page, e-mail, or just about any other attack vector.

[https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/05/windows-defender-nscript-remote-vulnerability/](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/05/windows-defender-nscript-remote-vulnerability/)

## Attention, Asus RT wireless router owners: Patch your gear now to squash web hijack bugs

-                                 Asus RT wireless routers have joined the SOHOpeless list  with poor cross-site request forgery protection affecting 30 variants of the devices.                The design blunders, labeled CVE-2017-5891, hit RT-AC and RT-N variants using firmware older than version 3.0.0.4.380.7378.                The lack of CSRF protection means that if the user has left the default credentials  admin:admin  in place, or if an attacker knows the admin password, a malicious webpage can log into the router when visited by the victim

- Nightwatch Cybersecurity, which discovered the issue, explained this week that the exploit is trivial: "Submit the base-64 encoded username and password as 'login_authorization' form post, to the '/login.cgi' URL of the browser."                A successful login means an attacker is able to change the router's settings, and hijack the DNS, for example, but Nightwatch admitted "we have not been able to exploit this issue consistently." Nightwatch also notes two JSONP bugs, which can reveal potentially sensitive information such as a network map and details about the router.                Asus has addressed the CSRF issues in a March firmware update, but doesn't consider one of Nightwatch's non-CSRF issues, CVE 2017-5892, to be serious enough to warrant a fix

- Also include in the updated firmware are fixes for:                CVE-2017-6547, a cross-site scripting bug in the routers' HTTP daemon.CVE-2017-6549, a session hijack vulnerability in the HTTP daemon.CVE-2017-6548, a remote code execution buffer overflow in the routers' networkmap command.                Get patching if you haven't already

## Intels Core i9 Extreme Edition CPU is an 18-core beast

- Now, Intel is upping the ante with a new family of processors for enthusiasts, the Core X-series, and it's anchored by the company's first 18-core CPU, the i9-7980XE.    

- It beats out AMD's 16-core Threadripper CPU, which was slated to be that company's most powerful consumer processor for 2017.

- And speaking of Turbo Boost 3.0, its performance has also been improved in the new Extreme Edition chips to increase both single and dual-core speeds.

- Rounding out the X-Series family are the quad-core i5-7640X and i7 models in 4-, 6- and 8-core models.While it might all seem like overkill, Intel says its Core i9 lineup was driven by the surprising demand for last year's 10-core chip.

- All of the new Core i9 processors, along with the 6- and 8-core i7 chips, feature scorching hot 140W thermal design points (TDPs), the maximum amount of power that they'll draw.

## Senate Committee Reportedly Zeroes In On Russian Cybersecurity Firm Widely Utilized in U.S.

-             The Senate Intelligence Committee reportedly spotlighted the potential threat surrounding a Russian cyber security firm during a classified hearing on Wednesday.ABC News detailed the congressional panels apparent concerns in a Wednesday article

- The hearings agenda had recently been amended to include U.S

- intelligence about Kaspersky Lab, a Moscow-based firm that has become one of the worlds largest and most respected cybersecurity firms, according to anonymous congressional sources.Per ABC:Current and former U.S

- officials worry that state-sponsored hackers could try to exploit Kaspersky Labs anti-virus software to steal and manipulate users files, read private emails or attack critical infrastructure in the U.S

- And they point to Kaspersky Lab executives with previous ties to Russian intelligence and military agencies.The Russian company, whose software are widely used in homes and businesses throughout the U.S., tried to downplay the concerns, underlining that it poses no threat to U.S

- customers and would never allow itself to be used as a tool of the Russian government.My response if Im asked to spy on anyone coming from any state, any government - not only Russian - will be definite no,' company CEO Eugene Kaspersky said.ABCs report also pointed out that the firms products are currently in use at federal agencies as the U.S

- Bureau of Prisons, the Consumer Product Safety Commission and even some segments of the Defense Department. And when Marco Rubio asked Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats if he would use the companys software on his devices, he reportedly answered, A resounding no from me.And, the report adds, all five of the other U.S

- intelligence officials unanimously agreed.Earlier this month, ABC News reported on the concerns these intel chiefs had about this particular cybersecurity firm:Senior members of the U.S

## JSON Feed Announced As Alternative To RSS

-  JSON Feed Announced As Alternative To RSS  (jsonfeed.org) 

- Reader Anubis IV writes: With Slashdot recently asking whether we still use RSS, it may come as a surprise that something interesting has happened in the world of news feeds this week.

- JSON Feed was launched as an alternative to RSS and Atom, eschewing the XML they rely on -- which is frequently malformed and difficult to parse -- in favor of a human readable JSON format that reflects the decades of combined experience its authors have in the field.

- The JSON Feed spec is a simple read that lays out a number of pragmatic benefits the format has over RSS and Atom, such as eliminating duplicate entries, adding the ability to paginate feeds so that old entries remain available, and reducing the need for clients to scrape sites to find images and other resources.

- Given that it's authored by the developers behind one of the earliest, popular RSS clients and a recently Kickstarted blogging platform, the format is intended to address the common pain points currently faced by developers when producing and parsing feeds. While it remains to be seen whether JSON Feed will escape the chicken-and-egg stage of adoption, several clients have already added support for the fledging format in the week since its announcement, including Feedbin, Inoreader, and NewsBlur.

## Can the heart be hacked? Experts find 8,000 security flaws in pacemaker software

- Security research firm WhiteScope carried out the assessment on implantable cardiac devices, physician programmers and home monitoring devices for four major manufacturers.The researchers found a worrying consistency across all vendors, highlighting inherent system weaknesses in file system encryption and storage of unencrypted patient data.The report notes that pacemaker security faces some serious challenges.LATEST: 100,000+ attacks of #WannaCry ramsomware detected in 24 hours #WanaCrypt0r#WCryhttps://t.co/1c4g1QCxC5pic.twitter.com/mOfouhFE7d RT (@RT_com) May 13, 2017 The recent WannaCry ransomware attack, which reportedly infected a medical device in a US hospital as well as medical services in the US and the UK, once again highlighted the potential implications of software vulnerabilities in the health sector.The new study builds on earlier research which raised concerns over security flaws in cardiac devices such as the implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) and the pacemaker, with WhiteScope researchers easily able to obtain subsystems for the four major vendors through public auction sites such as Ebay.One particular concern is the use of third party components, software that is sold by a company other than the original vendor.

- These components often have vulnerabilities that go unpatched.The report notes that as home monitoring devices receive updates to their permanent software, or firmware, via the patient support network, the potential exists to perform a man-in-the-middle attack and issue counterfeit firmware to the devices.A total of more than 8,000 vulnerabilities in third party components were identified across the four manufacturers.Given the commonality of the findings across different vendors, identification of implementation vulnerabilities as to any one vendor may expose those same vulnerabilities in other vendors and should be considered carefully before public disclosure, the report warns.The system used in diagnosis and programming the cardiac implants, which uses removable media/hard-drives, is also at risk from hackers who could extract the file system, according to the report.READ MORE: Feds investigating two dozen potential hacks targeting life-saving medical devicesThe study recommends vendors evaluate their systems and put effective security controls in place.

- It suggests techniques such as firmware packing, obfuscation and encryption would make it much more difficult to reverse engineer firmware.In 2013 the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) published guidelines highlighting the security loopholes in various medical devices connected to the internet.READ MORE: NSA learning how to snoop on pacemakersIn 2012, the late New Zealand Black Hat hacker Barnaby Jack famously demonstrated hacking a pacemaker to deliver a deadly electric shock at the BreakPoint security conference in Melbourne.

## Android Now Supports the Kotlin Programming Language

- Google describes Kotlin, which is an open sourced project under the Apache 2.0 license, as "a brilliantly designed, mature language that we believe will make Android development faster and more fun."

- The company notes that some have already adopted the programming language for their production apps, including Expedia, Flipboard, Pinterest, and Square.

- But Google's choice didn't just come down to the team believing Kotlin will make writing Android apps easier.

- Indeed, "the effortless interoperation between the two languages" was a large part of Kotlin's appeal to the Android team.

- This means you can add as little or as much Kotlin into your existing codebase as you want, mixing the two languages freely within the same project.

## Scientists Achieve Direct Counterfactual Quantum Communication For The First Time

- Quantum communication is a strange beast, but one of the weirdest proposed forms of it is called counterfactual communication - a type of quantum communication where no particles travel between two recipients.Theoretical physicists have long proposed that such a form of communication would be possible, but now, for the first time, researchers have been able to experimentally achieve it - transferring a black and white bitmap image from one location to another without sending any physical particles. If that sounds a little too out-there for you, don't worry, this is quantum mechanics, after all

- It's meant to be complicated

- But once you break it down, counterfactual quantum communication actually isn't as bizarre as it sounds.First up, let's talk about how this differs from regular quantum communication, also known as quantum teleportation, because isn't that also a form of particle-less information transfer?Well, not quite

- Regular quantum teleportation is based on the principle of entanglement - two particles that become inextricably linked so that whatever happens to one will automatically affect the other, no matter how far apart they are.This is what Einstein referred to as "spooky action at a distance", and scientists have already used it to send messages over vast distances.But that form of quantum teleportation still relies on particle transmission in some form or another

- The two particles usually need to be together when they're entangled before being sent to the people on either end of the message (so, they start in one place, and need to be transmitted to another before communication can occur between them).Alternatively, particles can be entangled at a distance, but it usually requires another particle, such as photons (particles of light), to travel between the two. Direct counterfactual quantum communication on the other hands relies on something other than quantum entanglement

- Instead, it uses a phenomenon called the quantum Zeno effect.Very simply, the quantum Zeno effect occurs when an unstable quantum system is repeatedly measured.In the quantum world, whenever you look at a system, or measure it, the system changes

- And in this case, unstable particles can never decay while they're being measured (just like the proverbial watched kettle that will never boil), so the quantum Zeno effect creates a system that's effectively frozen with a very high probability.If you want to delve a little deeper, the video below gives a great explanation:Counterfactual quantum communication is based on this quantum Zeno effect, and is defined as the transfer of a quantum state from one site to another without any quantum or classical particle being transmitted between them. This requires a quantum channel to run between two sites, which means there's always a small probability that a quantum particle will cross the channel

- If that happens, the system is discarded and a new one is set up.To set up such a complex system, researchers from the University of Science and Technology of China placed two single-photon detectors in the output ports of the last of an array of beam splitters.Because of the quantum Zeno effect, the system is frozen in a certain state, so it's possible to predict which of the detectors would 'click' whenever photons passed through

## Anti-AI AI: A device that notifies the wearer when a synthetic voice is detected

- This ended up being a rather simple app, doing as little processing as possible as ultimately we can see a future state of this project where the device stands alone.

- Keras is a python library that sits on top of Tensorflow and allowed us to build a neural network at a very high level.

- Keras essentially does all the work of generating a Tensorflow network, that we can then use to train and subsequently evaluate data.

- All the code can be found in our github repositoryNext StepsThis project is a work in progress.

- A great example being how to design software that chooses the best person/people to kill in a self driving car accident.http://moralmachine.mit.edu/The future holds countless more difficult questions posed by technological advances and we wont be able to answer them all with more technology.

## Democracy-minded DEF CON hackers promise punishing probe on US election computers

- Organizers at the DEF CON hacking conference in July are planning a mass cracking of US electronic election machines. The event, which for over 20 years has attracted the best and the brightest in the hacking community, will see a group hackathon against the voting machines that are used in every US election these days.

- The purpose is to check whether the machinery that underpins the electoral system is up to scratch. "Pretty much, just like everything else, it's time for hackers to come in and tell you what's possible and what's not," DEF CON founder Jeff Moss told Politico.

- " America was one of the earliest adopters of electronic voting systems, in part due to the fiasco of the 2000 presidential election that saw lawsuits over partially punched paper ballots.

- India is to hold a hackathon for its election machines to find out if they can be subverted, and the EU has voiced concern about voting security.

- US regulations on voting machines are lax to say the least, and the DEF CON crews should find lots of interesting holes. The Register has yet to receive a response from manufacturers as to whether they will be patching beforehand.

## Trump has an iPhone with one app: Twitter

-                   Enlarge Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg via Getty Images    Early in March, President Donald Trump surrendered his personal Android phonethe phone from which scores of controversial Twitter posts had been launched

- Based on Twitter metadata, Trump retired the Android device after expressing outrage over the DNC's failure to let the FBI search its servers and taunting Arnold Schwarzenegger on March 5

- The next day, he replaced it with an iPhone.        According to a report from Axios' Mike Allen, Twitter is the only application running on Trump's new iPhone

- And on his current overseas trip, staff have tried to limit his screen time in order to reduce the volume of his 140-character missives, Allen wrote:Trump himself has been pushing staff to give him more free time

- But staff does everything it can to load up his schedule to keep him from getting worked up watching cable coverage, which often precipitates his tweets

- It has worked well overseas so far.On the plus side, the iPhone is likely more secure by default than the Android device he previously used: a Samsung Galaxy of unknown provenance

- Trump reportedly received a secured mobile device from the Secret Service and White House Communications Agency shortly after his inauguration for voice communications

- But that device, like the one President Barack Obama received last year, is locked down to the degree that the president can't install applications on it or even directly place phone calls

## Frankfurt: 50% of German Dark web Traffic is Illegal

- On May 8, 2017, the Frankfurt public prosecutor spoke about the darknet and raised more questions regarding law enforcements job in policing hidden services

- He acknowledged that the line between crime and free speech was undeniably difficult to distinguish

- While allowing almost-unrestricted Tor access could save police resources and protect journalists, it might allow crime levels to go unchecked, he explained.And the opposite argument, possibly just as bad, carries a threat of equal weight

- Those who use the darknet for activities that he considered legal would likely suffer without a safe environment to be a whistleblower. And criminals, as always, would find a way to do exactly what they were doing before the police intervention.Andreas May, the Frankfurt public prosecutor who spoke about the topic, explained that the darknet, in his experience, was actually small in size when compared to the clearnet

- Worldwide, he said, only 2 million people used the darknet, counting both legal and illegal activity

- In Germany, nearly 50% of Tor users (or .onion travelers in any form) used hidden services for illegal activity.The German-speaking darknet users who participated in illegal activity often committed only minor crimes, however

- These, he said, rarely elicited law enforcements involvement

- The true criminals covered their tracks much more effectively than the stupid offenders. He said that there was basically nothing that could be done with respect to the intelligent users involved in the elicit parts of the darknetdrug marketplaces, for example.He said that some of the lowest hanging fruit came from darknet firearm dealers

## Yahoo! retires! bleeding! ImageMagick! to! kill! 0-day! vulnerability!

- How would you like US$778 per byte for your exploit? That's what security researcher Chris Evans just scored from Yahoo!, for an 18-byte demonstration of how private Yahoo! Mail images could leak. Even though the bug's been patched, Yahoo! decided it was one bug too many in the library, and retired it. Because (a) bugs get brands these days; and (b) *bleed attacks are hot right now, Evans called his trick Yahoobleed #1 (YB1). Evans turned up a zero-day, now patched, in the near-ubiquitous ImageMagick library.

- Here's how Evans describes it: The previous *bleed vulnerabilities have typically been out-of-bounds reads, but this one is the use of uninitialized memory.

- However, the leaked secrets will be limited to those present in freed heap chunks. The fix is simple enough:  (void) ResetMagickMemory(pixels,0,pixel_info_length);  In the unpatched version, Evans was able to attach an 18-byte exploit file to a message, send it to himself, and launch the preview pane.

- The resulting JPEG image served to my browser is based on uninitialized, or previously freed, memory content. In the outside world, it's now over to Linux distributions and other downstream users of ImageMagick to patch.

- The related-but-separate GraphicsMagick patched the same bug last year. Rather than keep the bounty, by the way, Evans donated it to a charity, and in recognition of this, Yahoo! doubled it.

## Ransomware scum have already unleashed kill-switch-free WannaCrypt variant

-                                 Miscreants have launched a ransomware worm variant that abuses the same vulnerability as the infamous WannaCrypt malware.                Danish firm Heimdal Security warned on Sunday that the new Uiwix strain doesn't include a kill-switch domain, like the one that proved instrumental in minimising the harm caused by WannaCrypt last week, although this is subject to some dispute.                "As far as I know there's only been two variants (one this morn) and none without [a kill]switch," security researcher Dave Kennedy told El Reg

- Other researchers, including Kevin Beaumont, are also telling us they haven't yet seen a variant of WannaCrypt without a kill switch.                What isn't in question is that follow-up attacks based on something similar to WannaCrypt are likely and that systems therefore really need protecting

- Black hats might well create a worm that attacks the same Windows vulnerability more stealthily to install a backdoor on the many vulnerable systems still out there, for example.                The WannaCrypt ransomware spread to devastating effect last week using worm -like capabilities that relied on a recently patched vulnerability in Microsoft's SMB file-sharing services (MS17-010)

- WannaCrypt used a purloined EternalBlue exploit originally developed by the US National Security Agency before it was leaked by the Shadow Brokers last month.                WannaCrypt's victims included the National Health Service, Spain's Telefonica and numerous other organisations across the world

- A techie at Telefonica *initially* claimed the initial infection vector was a phishing email but this claim has since been retracted

- The scale of the attack prompted Microsoft to take the highly unusual step of releasing patches for unsupported operating systems, including Windows XP

-

## While Microsoft griped about NSA exploit stockpiles, it stockpiled patches: Friday's WinXP fix was built in February

- Exclusive When the WannaCrypt ransomware exploded across the world over the weekend, infecting Windows systems using a stolen NSA exploit, Microsoft president Brad Smith quickly blamed the spy agency.

- In March, Microsoft emitted security fixes for supported versions of Windows to kill off the SMB vulnerability, striking Eternalblue dead on those editions. In April, exactly a month later, an NSA toolkit of hacking weapons, including Eternalblue, was dumped online by the Shadow Brokers: a powerful loaded gun was now in the hands of any willing miscreant. In May, just last week in fact, the WannaCrypt ransomware, equipped with this weapon, spread across networks and infected tens of thousands of machines worldwide, from hospital computers in the UK and Fedex terminals in the US, to railways in Germany and Russia, to cash machines in China. On Friday night, Microsoft issued emergency patches for unsupported versions of Windows that did not receive the March update  namely WinXP, Server 2003, and Windows 8 RT.

- In other words, Microsoft had fixes ready to go for its legacy systems in mid-February but only released them to the public last Friday after the world was engulfed in WannaCrypt. Here's the dates in the patches:  Windows 8 RT (64-bit x86): Feb 13, 2017

- Defence Secretary Michael Fallon claimed on Sunday that "less than five per cent of [NHS] trusts" still use Windows XP. Naturally, Microsoft doesn't want to kill the goose that lays such lovely golden eggs, by handing out patches for old gear for free.

- Suddenly, it's looking more like the robber baron we all know, and less like the white knight in cyber armor. We asked Microsoft to comment on the timing of its patching, but its spokespeople uselessly referred us back to Smith's blog.

## ImperialViolet - Maybe Skip SHA-3

- These repeated break-throughs caused something of a crisis of faith as cryptographers questioned whether we knew how to build hash functions at all.

- In the wake of this, NIST announced (PDF) a competition to develop SHA-3 in order to hedge the risk of SHA-2 falling.

- Thus, by the time it existed, it was no longer clear that SHA-3 was needed.

- It's convenient, although the same effect can be produced for a limited amount of output using HKDF, or by hashing to a key and running ChaCha20 or AES-CTR.

- The only argument that I can credit is that it's nice to have a backup hash function, but both SHA-256 and SHA-512 are commonly supported and have different cores.

## Chrome bug that lets sites secretly record you not a flaw, insists Google

-   Remember last years Google Chrome bug that gave pirates a way to steal streaming movies? Well, were ready for our closeup, Mr DeMille!

- Thus, after permission is given, the site can listen to the user whenever it  or a hacker  wants to. Th recording process is done via the JavaScript-based MediaRecorder API, according to BleepingComputer. Bar-Zik reported the issue and heard back from Google on the same day.

- Its argument was that the red circle and dot recording icon arent present in all versions of Chrome, so the real way to defend against an attack would be in the permissions popup.

- This code can use the camera for a millisecond to take a users picture, or for hours, recording the users movements or nearby audio. If the user doesnt notice the popup in his toolbar, theres no visual indicator to cue him that someone is accessing his audio and video components.

- Rather, they could exploit a cross-site scripting (XSS) flaw  also known as one of the web attacks that refuse to die  on legitimate websites that have already been granted audio and video access. Bug?

## Criminals are Now Exploiting SS7 Flaws to Hack Smartphone Two-Factor Authentication Systems

- Criminals are Now Exploiting SS7 Flaws to Hack Smartphone Two-Factor Authentication Systems        I've previously written about the serious vulnerabilities in the SS7 phone routing system

- Basically, the system doesn't authenticate messages

- Now, criminals are using it to hack smartphone-based two-factor authentication systems:In short, the issue with SS7 is that the network believes whatever you tell it

- SS7 is especially used for data-roaming: when a phone user goes outside their own provider's coverage, messages still need to get routed to them

- But anyone with SS7 access, which can be purchased for around 1000 Euros according to The Suddeutsche Zeitung, can send a routing request, and the network may not authenticate where the message is coming from.That allows the attacker to direct a target's text messages to another device, and, in the case of the bank accounts, steal any codes needed to login or greenlight money transfers (after the hackers obtained victim passwords).

## 'Cloak and dagger' vuln rolls critical hit against latest Android versions

-                                 Updated A distinct class of Android vulnerability has been unearthed by computer scientists at the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.                "Cloak and dagger" is a new kind of attack vector affecting Android devices (including the latest version, 7.1.2)

- "Attacks allow a malicious app to completely control the UI feedback loop and take over the device  without giving the user a chance to notice the malicious activity," according to the researchers.                The attacks would abuse one or both of the SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW ("draw on top") and BIND_ACCESSIBILITY_SERVICE ("a11y") functions

- If the malicious app is installed from the Play Store, the user is not notified about permissions

- No explicit permission needs to be granted for the attacks to succeed

- It's not a traditional bug but rather the malicious combinations of two legitimate permissions in popular apps

- Attacks including capturing passwords or extracting contacts might be possible, according to Georgia Tech team.                Risks arise largely from malicious code within pirated apps

- The attack method has been reported to Google.                Winston Bond, EMEA technical director at application security outfit Arxan Technologies, commented: "The discovery of the latest 'cloak and dagger' threat facing Android devices demonstrates just how dangerous corrupted or malicious fake applications can be.                "Users have traditionally been told they will be safe as long as they only download apps from official sources and don't pirate software, but we have increasingly seen cases of malicious apps being downloaded from within app stores or official websites.                "Developers can no longer rely on the 'walled garden' approach of app stores to protect their users from malicious copies of their apps, and need to proactively defend their software from criminals seeking to tamper with its code and turn it into a weapon."                More details on the method can be found in a video put together by the Georgia Tech researchers (below)

-                   Youtube Video                Updated to add                "We've been in close touch with the researchers and, as always, we appreciate their efforts to help keep our users safer," a Google spokesman told The Reg.                "We have updated Google Play Protect - our security services on all Android devices with Google Play - to detect and prevent the installation of these apps

## Judge: It's OK If Best Buy's Geek Squad Nerds Search Your PC for Illegal Content

-      A judge presiding over a child pornography case that was set in motion in 2012 has ruled that users have no legal expectation of privacy when they hand over their computers to Best Buy's Geek Squad IT technicians. This was the most recent development in a case that started in 2012 when a California doctor named Mark Rettenmaier was arrested after Best Buy computer technicians found child abuse images on his hard drive. Short history of the Rettenmaier case According to court documents, everything started in November 2011 when Rettenmaier discovered that his computer wouldn't boot anymore. The doctor, a gynecologist from Mission Viejo, California, took his PC to the local Best Buy store, where technicians discovered the computer had a bad hard drive. Rettenmaier, wishing to regain access to his old files, agreed to purchase data recovery services from Best Buy's Geek Squad.

- This service meant that his local Best Buy technician sent the hard drive to a Geek Squad branch in Brooks, Kentucky, where other specialized employees would carry out this complex operation. At the Brooks branch, while recovering files from Rettenmaier's hard drive, a Geek Squad employee found a small thumbnail image "of a fully nude, white prepubescent female on her hands and knees on a bed, with a brown choker-type collar around her neck.

- Things started unraveling as years went by and the defendant's lawyers began to take the prosecution's evidence apart. Everything culminated in early 2017 when Rettenmaier's lawyers discovered that the FBI had specifically recruited and trained Geek Squad technicians to search for illegal files on users' computers using custom-built software. Defense lawyers argued that the FBI was using Geek Squad technicians as a way to skirt privacy laws and search for data for which they would usually have need probable cause and a warrant. Furthermore, lawyers found that the FBI was paying these Geek Squad employees between $500 and $1,000 per each report they filed. This immediately cast a shadow of doubt over the prosecution's findings, as financial motivations now drove Geek Squad employees to find as many "suspects" as possible. For its part, Best Buy denied having any knowledge of the FBI's arrangement with its Geek Squad division. Geek Squad technicians allowed to search any data they want Last week, the judge presiding over this case answered some motions filed by Rettenmaier's lawyers in the past months. The judge approved of the FBI's relation with Geek Squad technicians, and their actions of intentionally looking for suspicious data. According to a judge's decision, Rettenmaier lost his right to privacy when he signed a repairs contract with Best Buy and even gave his verbal agreement for technicians to search his laptop. The decision looked like a victory for the prosecution, but this would end up being the only win they would gain, as the judge would side with Rettenmaier on multiple other issues. Prosecution case takes a hard hit For starters, the judge disagreed with the FBI's assessment that the image which Geek Squad technicians found was adult in nature.

- This small detail leaves the door open to suspicions of third-party tampering, as the prosecution can't determine ownership for the file. Additionally, a Department of Justice computer expert also testified that users aren't always in control over the data on their hard drive.

- For example, thousands of images are loaded on a user's computer every day when he surfs the Internet, without the user ever having any idea or control of what's saved to his device. With no information of where the image came from, the lack of any graphical depiction of child abuse, and the disingenuous search warrant, the judge ruled to suppress all of the evidence collected by the FBI from Rettenmaier's home in early 2012. After the judge has decimated most of the evidence, prosecutors now have until January-February 2018 to decide if they want to go forward with the case.

## History is Made: Bitcoin Prices Top $2,000 to Set New All-Time High

-                                     The price of bitcoin surpassed $2,000 for the first time in history today, pushing the cryptocurrency to a fresh, new record amid rising trader interest.The currency's price rose as much as 2.62% during the session, according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index (BPI) to hit a press time high of $2,019

- By rising above $2,000, bitcoin's price has surged more than 100% this year and nearly 125% since hitting an annual low of $891.51 in late March.Now that the the digital currency has surpassed this key, psychological level of $2,000, it could experience some significant tailwinds, according to several analysts who spoke with CoinDesk.High hopesArthur Hayes, co-founder and CEO of leveraged digital currency platform BitMEX, told CoinDesk that should bitcoin prices "convincingly" surpass $2,000, "the rate of price appreciation will accelerate dramatically".Charles Hayter, co-founder and CEO of CryptoCompare, also weighed in on the importance of this price level, stating:"As a psychological level, bitcoin hitting $2,000 is an important milestone and will generate further interest that could boost the price further."Speaking of interest, analysts generally agreed that bitcoin's rise above $2,000 could spur significant attention from the media

- Hayes offered similar sentiment, stating that a sustained rise above $2,000 would prompt every major financial media outlet to cover bitcoin.In spite of all this visibility, Hayter cautioned that sometimes, the "lack of sophistication" that goes along with mainstream media coverage "can be dangerous as it snowballs momentum."Interestingly enough, Google Trends data has thus far shown that online searches for the word "bitcoin" have still not recovered to the all-time high they set in December 2013, but they are getting closer

- While a figure of 100 represents the highest point for these searches, the metric stood at 85 at the time of report.While many agreed that bitcoin's rise above $2,000 would spur greater media coverage, the factors that drove the currency's price above this level seemed a bit more complex.Growing trader interestOne development that has coincided with bitcoin's sharp price gains over the last several months is the rising interest of traders, as measured by trading volume at major exchanges

- Earlier this month, both Kraken and Poloniex announced that they were experiencing surging transaction activity.Kraken indicated that on 5th May, trading volume across all digital assets surpassed $178m, setting an all-time high and beating the prior record by 25%.Poloniex expressed similar sentiment, saying in a statement that:"We have never seen such enthusiasm for trading blockchain tokens as we have in the past few months

- Since January, we've seen an increase of more than 600% active traders online and regularly process 640% more transactions than we did merely [four] months ago."Another factor that has helped drive bitcoin prices is the rising influence of Japan in the bitcoin markets, where the technology is now regulated

- The Japanese yen is the single largest currency being exchanged for bitcoin, accounting for more than 45% of the money flow into bitcoin at the time of report, according to CryptoCompare data.The US dollar came in a relatively distant second, making up approximately 30% of the money flowing into bitcoin, according to additional CryptoCompare figures.This increase in the use of the Japanese yen comes after Japan moved to formally recognize bitcoin as a legal method of payment starting 1st April

- The country's lawmakers enacted legislation that both classified the cryptocurrency as a type of prepaid payment instrument and also caused it to fall under anti-money laundering and know-your-customer rules.Scaling dilemma fadesBitcoin prices have even been rising sharply in spite of the cryptocurrency's ongoing scaling dilemma, an ongoing issue with its transaction capacity that members of the bitcoin community have been trying to resolve.Developers could address this problem by increasing block size, increasing the number of transactions that can fit into an individual block through Segregated Witness, or both

## Firefox 55: Flash Will Become 'Ask To Activate' For Everyone

- An anonymous reader quotes a report from BleepingComputer: Starting with the release of Firefox 55, the Adobe Flash plugin for Firefox will be set to "Ask to Activate" by default for all users.

- Flash is currently the only NPAPI plugin still supported in Firefox, and moving its default setting from "Always Activate" to "Ask to Activate" is just another step towards the final step of stop supporting Flash altogether.

- This new Flash default setting is already live in Firefox's Nightly Edition and will move through the Alpha and Beta versions as Firefox nears its v55 Stable release.

- By moving Flash to a click-to-play setting, Firefox will indirectly start to favor HTML5 content over Flash for all multimedia content.

- Other browsers like Google Chrome, Brave, or Opera already run Flash on a click-to-play setting, or disabled by default. Firefox is scheduled to be released on August 8, 2017.

## Ethereum Could Be Worth More Than Bitcoin Very Soon

- 91257313story Ethereum Could Be Worth More Than Bitcoin Very Soon  (inc.com)   Ethereum is an open software platform based on blockchain technology that enables developers to build and deploy decentralized applications, according to Blockgeeks

- It is currently the second most valuable cryptocurrency on the planet, but it could overthrow Bitcoin and become the most valuable cryptocurrency in the near future

- Inc.com reports:  If you aren't familiar, what Bitcoin does for payments, Ethereum does for anything involving programming and computing

- While it utilizes its own version of a blockchain, it is functionally different from Bitcoin

- For example, on the Ethereum platform you could host a crowdfunding campaign or any type of "smart contract." Ethereum's goal is to make a decentralized internet

- And it has a very good shot at becoming "the new internet," literally

- It could one day replace a lot of technology and ways that we host and execute code online

- As of the time of writing, Ethereum has a market cap of over $17 billion

## Chipotle Says 'Most' of Its Restaurants Were Infected With Credit Card Stealing Malware

- 91353289story Chipotle Says 'Most' of Its Restaurants Were Infected With Credit Card Stealing Malware  (theverge.com)   Earlier this year, Chipotle announced that the their payment processing system was hacked

- Today, the company has released more information about the hack, identifying the malware that was responsible and releasing a new tool to help customers check whether the restaurant they visited was involved

- The company did not say how many restaurants were affected, but it did tell The Verge that "most" locations nationwide may have been involved

- The Verge reports:  "The malware searched for track data (which sometimes has cardholder name in addition to card number, expiration date, and internal verification code) read from the magnetic stripe of a payment card as it was being routed through the POS device," Chipotle said in a statement

- "There is no indication that other customer information was affected." We browsed through the tool and found that every state Chipotle operates in had restaurants that were breached, including most major cities

- The restaurants were vulnerable in various time frames between March 24th and April 18th, 2017

- Chipotle also operates another chain called Pizzeria Locale, which was affected by the hack as well

- (The list of identified restaurants can be found here, which includes locations in Kansas, Missouri, Colorado, and Ohio.) Chipotle noted that not all locations have been identified, but it's a starting guide to check whether your visit lines up with the breached period

## 'Highly Educated' Drug Users Fuel Boom in Illicit Narcotics Trade on Dark Web

- So it may be that the UK and some of the other countries in our survey are cottoning onto that now," Barratt explained. The dark web is also providing users with the opportunity to experiment with many different drugs.

- Globally, MDMA is the drug most often bought on the dark web, with 49 percent users obtaining it there.

- Naturally, people who don't have this kind of quite sophisticated technology available can't really just go onto the dark net and press a button and get a drug delivered.

- " "There's a lot more that you have to do, in terms of having Bitcoin, having a fixed address where you can actually receive the package and so on, so it's not necessarily open to all groups in society," Barratt said.

## 7-Year-Old Samba Flaw Lets Hackers Access Thousands of Linux PCs Remotely

- A remote attacker could use this Samba arbitrary module loading vulnerability (POC code) to upload a shared library to a writable share and then cause the server to load and execute malicious code.  The vulnerability is hell easy to exploit.

- Just one line of code is required to execute malicious code on the affected system.  simple.create_pipe("/path/to/target.so") However, the Samba exploit has already been ported to Metasploit, a penetration testing framework, enabling researchers as well as hackers to exploit this flaw easily.   Patch and Mitigations  The maintainers of Samba has already patched the issue in their new versions Samba versions 4.6.4/4.5.10/4.4.14, and are urging those using a vulnerable version of Samba to install the patch as soon as possible.  But if you can not upgrade to the latest versions of Samba immediately, you can work around the vulnerability by adding the following line to your Samba configuration file smb.conf:  nt pipe support = no Once added, restart the network's SMB daemon (smbd) and you are done.

- This change will prevent clients from fully accessing some network machines, as well as disable some expected functions for connected Windows systems.  While Linux distribution vendors, including Red Hat and Ubuntu, have already released patched versions for its users, the larger risk is that from NAS device consumers that might not be updated as quickly.  Craig Williams of Cisco said that given the fact that most NAS devices run Samba and have very valuable data, the vulnerability "has potential to be the first large-scale Linux ransomware worm.

## Car Security Experts Dump All Their Research and Vulnerabilities Online

-  [Charlie Miller] and [Chris Valasek] Have just released all their research including (but not limited to) how they hacked a Jeep Cherokee after the newest firmware updates which were rolled out in response to their Hacking of a Cherokee in 2015. FCA, the Corp that owns Jeep had to recall 1.5 million Cherokees to deal with the 2015 hack, issuing them all a patch.

- However the patch wasnt all that great it actually gave [Charlie] and [Chris] even more control of the car than they had in the first place once exploited.

- The papers they have released are a goldmine for anyone interesting in hacking or even just messing around with cars via the CAN bus.

- It goes on to chronicle multiple hacks, from changing the speedometer to remotely controlling a car through CAN message injection.

- Their statement on the matter is below. Under no circumstances does FCA condone or believe its appropriate to disclose how-to information that would potentially encourage, or help enable hackers to gain unauthorized and unlawful access to vehicle systems. We anticipate seeing an increasing number of security related releases and buzz as summer approaches.

## Wikipedia's Switch To HTTPS Has Successfully Fought Government Censorship

- From a report: HTTPS prevents governments and others from seeing the specific page users are visiting.

- Up until 2015, Wikipedia offered its service using both HTTP and HTTPS, which meant that when countries like Pakistan or Iran blocked the certain articles on the HTTP version of Wikipedia, the full version would still be available using HTTPS.

- [...] The Harvard researchers began by deploying an algorithm which detected unusual changes in Wikipedia's global server traffic for a year beginning in May 2015.

- This data was then combined with a historical analysis of the daily request histories for some 1.7 million articles in 286 different languages from 2011 to 2016 in order to determine possible censorship events.

- [...] After a painstakingly long process of manual analysis of potential censorship events, the researchers found that, globally, Wikipedia's switch to HTTPS had a positive effect on the number censorship events by comparing server traffic from before and after the switch in June of 2015.

## Talks on planned laptop ban for European-US flights end with no deal

- Discussions over keeping laptops and large electronics out of more US-bound flight cabins ended yesterday without an agreement to widen the ban. In March, the US Department of Homeland Security barred US-bound passengers from 10 airports from taking any electronics larger than a cell phone onto planes.

- The UK instituted a similar ban, but it covered whole countries rather than specific airports. Earlier this month, CBS News reported talks were underway about expanding the laptop ban to cover flights between the US from Europe.

- The decision came one day after an international group of airlines wrote a strongly worded letter to the EU and the US State Department blasting the proposed ban.

- The president has acknowledged he shared classified information about a threat involving the use of laptops on airplanes by ISIS.

- On Twitter, he said he did so for "humanitarian reasons, plus I want Russia to greatly step up their fight against ISIS  terrorism.

## ExtraTorrent Shuts Down for Good

-  In a surprise move, ExtraTorrent decided to shut down today, for good.

-  Users who access the sites homepage are welcomed by a short but clear message, indicating that the popular torrent index will not return (the message appears intermittently). ExtraTorrent has shut down permanently. ExtraTorrent with all mirrors goes offline.. We permanently erase all data.

- ET was a place to be.... TorrentFreak reached out to ExtraTorrent operator SaM who confirmed that this is indeed the end of the road for the site. Its time we say goodbye, he said, without providing more details.  With ExtraTorrents demise the BitTorrent community has lost yet another prominent player.

- Nonetheless, ExtraTorrent was determined to develop an audience of its own. The site went on to outgrow many of its predecessors and with millions of daily visitors, ExtraTorrent ended up as the second largest torrent site, trailing only behind The Pirate Bay. The sites popularity placed it in the crosshairs of various entertainment industry groups in recent months.

-  Update: We were informed by SaM that ExtraTorrents release group ETRG is gone now. Ettv and Ethd could remain operational if they get enough donations to sustain the expenses and if they people handling it ready to keep going, we were told.  Breaking news, more information may follow.

## Net Neutrality Goes Down in Flames as FCC Votes To Kill Title II Rules

- As we feared yesterday, the rollback of net neutrality rules officially began today.

- The FCC voted along party lines today to formally consider Chairman Ajit Pai's plan to scrap the legal foundation for the rules and to ask the public for comments on the future of prohibitions on blocking, throttling and paid prioritization.

- ArsTechnica adds: The Federal Communications Commission voted 2-1 today to start the process of eliminating net neutrality rules and the classification of home and mobile Internet service providers as common carriers under Title II of the Communications Act.

- But Chairman Ajit Pai is making no promises about reinstating the two-year-old net neutrality rules that forbid ISPs from blocking or throttling lawful Internet content, or prioritizing content in exchange for payment.

- Pai's proposal argues that throttling websites and applications might somehow help Internet users.

## Security shield slingers are loving Prez Trump's cybersecurity order

-                                 US President Donald Trump's cybersecurity executive order, signed on Thursday after a series of delays, will make federal agency heads accountable for protecting their networks.                On the other side of the fence, computer security product makers have broadly welcomed the policy, which also calls on government and industry to reduce the threat from automated attacks on the internet.                The delayed cybersecurity executive order aims to bolster the government's information security while protecting the nation's critical infrastructure from cyberattacks

- The order is important because it sets the direction for US infosec policy in government and beyond

- Unlike many of President Trump's other policy initiatives, the order is largely uncontroversial and might (whisper this gently) be seen largely as a continuation of measures former President Barrack Obama was putting into place.                Kevin Davis, VP of public sector at Splunk, said: "Improving cybersecurity is one of the few items both sides of the aisle can reach across and agree on, and today's executive order is a good, bipartisan step to better protect our government's networks and critical infrastructure."                "Hackers' preferred attack methods against the public and private sector change daily, and Trump's executive order is a good reflection of the need for adaptability in today's threatscape

- And as methods of cybercrime continue to evolve, it will be important to government agencies to rely on data analysis, to quantify the risk so they can adapt appropriately," he added.                Some experts argue that the order will spur an overdue rethink about federal IT security strategies.                Davis explained that the order differs in several important respects from the draft order floated by the Trump administration back in January.                "The draft order gave DoD [US Department of Defense] a very muscular role in almost every component of the original plan," Davis said

- "In the signed order issued today, DoD is tasked with contributing to the plan in areas more in line with its war-fighting capabilities.                "Similarly, the earlier order sought to explore ways to promote cyber resiliency in the private sector by creating financial incentives (ie, tax breaks) to spend on cybersecurity

- The signed order turns to market transparency to encourage critical infrastructure entities to properly mitigate cyber risks

- This approach transfers the costs and risks of improper planning to the infrastructure owners and investors and away from the taxpayer," he added.                The buck stops there                The order means federal agency heads will be held accountable for the effective management of the cyber risk within their agencies, something that was always an implicit duty but is now an explicit responsibility

- Agency bosses will be obliged to implement the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) risk management framework to develop assessments and plans

## Macron campaign team used honeypot accounts to fake out Fancy Bear

- "Even if it made them lose one minute, were happy. The bait documents may have caused the attackers to rush their efforts.

- Multiple documents were proven to be forgeries, including one which appeared to be an invoice for a Bitcoin payment for mephedrone ("bath salts") to be sent to the French National Assembly.

- The Bitcoin wallet and blockchain transaction data was easily determined to be fake. WikiLeaks, which initially spread links to the documents posted by the attackers, responded to Ars' previous coverage of the hack by tweeting, "It is unlikely that it could have been a mistake.

## Yahoobleed flaw leaked private e-mail attachments and credentials

- For years, Yahoo Mail has exposed a wealth of private user data because it failed to update widely used image-processing software that contained critical vulnerabilities.

- That's according to a security researcher who warned that other popular services are also likely to be leaking sensitive subscriber secrets. Chris Evans, the researcher who discovered the vulnerabilities and reported them privately to Yahoo engineers, has dubbed them "Yahoobleed" because the vulnerabilities caused the site to bleed contents stored in server memory.

- The easy-to-exploit flaws resided in ImageMagick, an image-processing library that's supported by PHP, Ruby, NodeJS, Python, and about a dozen other programming languages.

- "Yahoobleed2" worked by exploiting the vulnerability fixed in January 2015. A real mess Together, the bugs allowed attackers to obtain browser cookies, authentication tokens, and private image attachments belonging to Yahoo Mail users.

- So it seems unlikely that everyone has updated for this very recent issue. Evans said a competing image-processing library called GraphicsMagick patched the same underlying bug in March 2016.

## This Open Source "Concrete Ball" Has Built-In TOR Protection And Internet Blackout Dial For Your Computer

-  Nowadays, people are more interested in finding ways to protect their privacy on the internet.

- But in recent times, hardware-based privacy solutions are also finding their place in normal households, one of them being CUJO, which is a smart firewall.

-  A Spanish designer duo Roman Terre and Angeles Angulo have built a prototype of a rather simpler privacy solution called Thero.

- The privacy hardware can be connected to devices via a cable or act as a wireless access point. Thero wont be released as a commercial product until they improve its software.

- In future, Theros designs will also be made open source.  If you have something to add, drop your thoughts and feedback.

## Google's AI Is Now Creating Its Own AI

- Its also better than any living human at the infinitely complex game, Go. As impressive as this is, Google is determined to show the world its not just a one-trick pony.

- Google had the bright idea of getting the pre-existing AI to create its own layers of code, and as it turns out, its doing it a lot faster and more effectively than its human technicians ever could. Googles AI has become its own creator. An accompanying blog post by the researchers working on the project compare the new AI to a child, with respect to the original AIs parents. A controller neural net can propose a child model architecture, which can then be trained and evaluated for quality on a particular task, they write.

- Whatever the task, it is monitored by the controlling AI throughout, and the feedback is used by the AI to improve the child. We repeat this process thousands of times  generating new architectures, testing them, and giving that feedback to the controller to learn from.  Google's AutoML system, explained.

- Google Developers via YouTube The AutoML procedure has so far been applied to image recognition and language modeling.

- Small subroutines have cropped up in the latters creations, those that appear to have no apparent use to human coders. The team go on to suggest that this act of self-coding could be, counterintuitively, placed in the hands of the layperson. By starting off with a raw AI, one thats able to construct code itself, anyone could input a few basic commands, as if theyre placing an order for a specific type of bespoke AI program.

## CCC | Chaos Computer Clubs breaks iris recognition system of the Samsung Galaxy S8

- The system promises secure individual user authentication by using the unique pattern of the human iris. A new test conducted by CCC hackers shows that this promise cannot be kept: With a simple to make dummy-eye the phone can be fooled into believing that it sees the eye of the legitimate owner.

- If you value the data on your phone  and possibly want to even use it for payment  using the traditional PIN-protection is a safer approach than using body features for authentication, says Dirk Engling, spokesperson for the CCC.

- A successful attacker gets access not only to the phones data, but also the owners mobile wallet. Iris recognition in general is about to break into the mass market: Access control systems, also at airports and borders, mobile phones, the inevitable IoT devices, even payment solutions and VR systems are being equipped with the technology.

- [1] The security risk to the user from iris recognition is even bigger than with fingerprints as we expose our irises a lot.

- In the infrared light spectrum  usually filtered in cameras  the fine, normally hard to distinguish details of the iris of dark eyes are well recognizable.

## New SMB Worm Uses Seven NSA Hacking Tools. WannaCry Used Just Two

- 91220647story New SMB Worm Uses Seven NSA Hacking Tools

- WannaCry Used Just Two  (bleepingcomputer.com)   An anonymous reader writes: Researchers have detected a new worm that is spreading via SMB, but unlike the worm component of the WannaCry ransomware, this one is using seven NSA tools instead of two

- Named EternalRocks, the worm seems to be in a phase where it is infecting victims and building its botnet, but not delivering any malware payload. EternalRocks is far more complex than WannaCry's SMB worm

- For starters, it uses a delayed installation process that waits 24 hours before completing the install, as a way to evade sandbox environments

- Further, the worm also uses the exact same filenames as WannaCry in an attempt to fool researchers of its true origin, a reason why the worm has evaded researchers almost all week, despite the attention WannaCry payloads have received. Last but not least, the worm does not have a killswitch domain, which means the worm can't be stopped unless its author desires so

- Because of the way it was designed, it is trivial for the worm's owner to deliver any type of malware to any of the infected computers

- Unfortunately, because of the way he used the DOUBLEPULSAR implant, one of the seven NSA hacking tools, other attackers can hijack its botnet and deliver their own malware as well

- IOCs are available in a GitHub repo.  Ars Technica quotes security researchers who say "there are at least three different groups that have been leveraging the NSA exploit to infect enterprise networks since late April..

## WikiLeaks Reveals 'Athena' CIA Spying Program Targeting All Versions of Windows

-      WikiLeaks has published a new batch of the ongoing Vault 7 leak, detailing a spyware framework  which "provides remote beacon and loader capabilities on target computers"  allegedly being used by the CIA that works against every version of Microsoft's Windows operating systems, from Windows XP to Windows 10.  Dubbed Athena/Hera, the spyware has been designed to take full control over the infected Windows PCs remotely, allowing the agency to perform all sorts of things on the target machine, including deleting data or uploading malicious software, and stealing data and send them to CIA server.  The leak, which includes a user manual of Athena, overview of the technology, and demonstration on how to use this spyware, reveals that the program has two implications:  Primary: Athena for XP to Windows 10  Secondary: Hera for Windows 8 through Windows 10  According to the whistleblower organization, Athena has the ability to allow the CIA agents to modify its configuration in real time, while the implant is on target "to customize it to an operation.

- "  "Once installed, the malware provides a beaconing capability (including configuration and task handling), the memory loading/unloading of malicious payloads for specific tasks and the delivery and retrieval of files to/from a specified directory on the target system," WikiLeaks claims. The leaked documents suggest that Athena, written in Python programming language, was developed in August 2015, just a month after Microsoft released its Windows 10 operating system.  Interestingly, one document also suggests that the CIA agents have been advised to make sure that the spyware should not get caught by antivirus software programs, especially Kaspersky AV software.   Athena has been developed by the CIA in cooperation with Siege Technologies  an American cyber security firm that offers offensive cyber war technologies and works in close cooperation with the United States government.  However, WikiLeaks has not provided any detail about the operations being conducted by the agency using Athena, but it is not hard to imagine how the intelligence agency would be using this program to spy on their targets.  Last week, WikiLeaks dumped two apparent CIA malware frameworks  AfterMidnight and Assassin  for the Microsoft Windows platform that has been designed to monitor and report back actions on the infected remote host computer and execute malicious actions.  Since March, the whistleblowing group has published nine batches of "Vault 7" series, which includes the latest and last week leaks, along with the following batches:  Archimedes  a man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack tool allegedly created by the CIA to target computers inside a Local Area Network (LAN). Scribbles  a piece of software allegedly designed to embed 'web beacons' into confidential documents, allowing the spying agency to track insiders and whistleblowers. Grasshopper  reveal a framework which allowed the agency to easily create custom malware for breaking into Microsoft's Windows and bypassing antivirus protection. Marble  revealed the source code of a secret anti-forensic framework, basically an obfuscator or a packer used by the CIA to hide the actual source of its malware. Dark Matter  focused on hacking exploits the agency designed to target iPhones and Macs. Weeping Angel  spying tool used by the agency to infiltrate smart TV's, transforming them into covert microphones. Year Zero  dumped CIA hacking exploits for popular hardware and software.

## Chelsea Manning released from prison

-  Chelsea Manning, the army private who released a vast trove of US state secrets and was punished by the US military for months in penal conditions denounced by the UN as torture, has been released from a military prison in Kansas after serving seven years of a 35-year sentence.    Chelsea Manning  (@xychelsea) First steps of freedom!!

- Im figuring things out right nowwhich is exciting, awkward, fun, and all new for me. Mannings disclosures included Collateral Murder, the footage of a US Apache helicopter attack in Baghdad in which two Reuters journalists and other civilians were killed. Her seven-year ordeal has seen her held captive in Iraq, Kuwait and the US, always in male-only detention facilities.

- In commuting to time served her 35-year sentence  the longest ever penalty dished out in the US to an official leaker  the outgoing commander in chief said that justice had been served. Speaking from her prison cell as she prepared for release last week, Manning said: Im looking forward to breathing the warm spring air again. I want that indescribable feeling of connection with people and nature again, without razor wire or a visitation booth.

- I am so proud of Chelsea and delighted she will finally be free again. Manning moved to Haverfordwest in Wales in 2001 when she was 14 to live with her mother, but returned to the US where she was born and brought up after school ended.

- It is a day that I am reflecting on how the military justice system could veer so far off course. The lawyer added that the particular constellation of players involved in this case, the desire to make an example out of Manning, and the win at all costs mentality of the prosecution created a powder keg where the ability to achieve a just result was impossible.

## Patches Available for Linux Sudo Vulnerability

- Red Hat, Debian and other Linux distributions yesterday pushed out patches for a high-severity vulnerability in sudo that could be abused by a local attacker to gain root privileges.Sudo is a program for Linux and UNIX systems that allows standard users to run specific commands as a superuser, such as adding users or performing system updates.Related PostsSamba Patches Wormable Bug Exploitable With One Line Of CodeMay 25, 2017 , 12:20 pmRussian-Speaking Turla Joins APT EliteApril 3, 2017 , 12:09 pmCisco Patches Critical IOx VulnerabilityMarch 23, 2017 , 3:24 pmIn this case, researchers at Qualys found a vulnerability in sudos get_process_ttyname function that allows a local attacker with sudo privileges to run commands as root or elevate privileges to root.An alert on the sudo project website says SELinux must be enabled and sudo built with SELinux support for the vulnerability to be triggered

- Sudo 1.8.6p7 through 1.8.20 are affected

- Users should update sudo to 1.8.20p1.On Linux systems, sudo parses the /proc/[pid]/stat file to determine the device number of the processs tty (field 7)

- The fields in the file are space-delimited, but it is possible for the command name (field 2) to include white space (including newline), which sudo does not account for, the sudo advisory said

- A user with sudo privileges can cause sudo to use a device number of the users choosing by creating a symbolic link from the sudo binary to a name that contains a space, followed by a number.Qualys declined to comment for this article.This issue, if exploited, allows the attacker to circumvent the controls and do more than they are supposed to do, the Red Hat security team told Threatpost

- The attacker has to already be on a server and granted access to commands via sudo for the vulnerability to be used.Red Hat said it released fixes yesterday for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7, as did a number of other distributions including Debian for its wheezy, jessie and sid releases, and SUSE Linux for a number of its products.Qualys said it will publish its exploit once systems have had time to patch.On an SELinux-enabled system, if a user is Sudoer for a command that does not grant him full root privileges, he can overwrite any file on the filesystem (including root-owned files) with his commands output, because relabel_tty() (in src/selinux.c) calls open(O_RDWRO_NONBLOCK) on his tty and dup2()s it to the commands stdin, stdout, and stderr, Qualys researchers wrote in an advisory published on the OSS-Security mailing list

- This allows any Sudoer user to obtain full root privileges.

- In order to stream audio or video content, a user must first grant a website permission to access his audio and video components.When a website receives this permission, it can run JavaScript code that records audio or video content, before sending it over the Internet to the other participants of an WebRTC stream

- This recording process is done via the JavaScript-based MediaRecorder API.Attack code is launched via a Chrome popupBar-Zik discovered that the code that does the recording doesn't necessarily have to run on the original tab where the permission was granted.Because the permission to access audio and video data was granted for an entire domain, the Israeli developer realized he could start a headless Chrome window (popup) where he could run the code to record audio and video.Because Chrome shows the red circle and dot icon in a window's tab, the icon doesn't appear for the popup because this headless window doesn't have a tab bar.Researcher reported issue to Google, but no urgent fix is comingBar-Zik told Bleeping Computer that after he had verified this issue with family members and other peers, he submitted a bug report to Google.The bug report is available here

- The report also includes a benign demo that asks the user for permission, launches a popup when a user clicks o button, records 20 seconds of audio, and provides a download link for the recorded file

- The proof-of-concept code is also available for download from here.In a response Bar-Zik received on the same day, Google declined to consider this bug a security issue.This isn't really a security vulnerability - for example, WebRTC on a mobile device shows no indicator at all in the browser

## LastPass now supports 2FA auth, completely undermines 2FA auth

- Password manager LastPass has added a new feature to its software: the ability to store two-factor authentication codes.

- For hackers. Increasingly, people with sense use two-factor auth as a way of ensuring that it is much harder for miscreants to break into their accounts, and to detect if anyone is anyone is trying to do so.

- When you log in, you provide your username and password, hand over that minute's code, and in you go if it's all correct. And that's where LastPass comes in.

- By putting two-factor auth codes in the same piece of software, that single point of failure becomes even more stark.

- It is placing eggs on top of an already egg-filled basket. But of course in the real world, this is just a theoretical risk.

## Exclusive: this is the Essential Phone

-   The Essential Phone, brought to us by the person who created Android, is finally ready for the spotlight

- Its an incredibly audacious and ambitious project, with an outlandish screen and the beginnings of a modular ecosystem

-       First, the Android phone basics: the Essential Phone costs $699 with top-of-the-line specs and features

- As you can see above, it prominently features an edge-to-edge display that one-ups even the Samsung Galaxy S8 by bringing it all the way to the the top of the phone, wrapping around the front-facing selfie camera

- Its a unique take on a big screen that makes the phone stand out  and its smart, too

- Often, the status bar at the top of an Android phone doesnt fill that middle space with icons, so its efficient

- The screen does leave some bezel at the bottom of the phone, but nevertheless its as close to the whole front of a phone being display as Ive seen.                                                                Photo: Essential            Essential is launching the phone in the US to start, and its filled the phone with radios that should make it work on all major carriers, alongside usual Android flagship internals like a Qualcomm 835 processor, 4GB of RAM, and 128GB of storage

- And because Essential seems to be hanging its hat on the idea of shipping phones without extraneous junk (the designers dont even put a logo on the exterior), chances seem good that there wont be a ton of extraneous software laded on to slow the phone down.                                                                Photo: Essential            Essential is clearly planning on releasing a very well-made phone: the screen looks promising, it has no annoying logos, and it is built with a combination of titanium and ceramic so it can survive a drop test without blemish, unlike the aluminum competitor devices. (Those would be Samsung and Apple, if youre wondering.)            But nice hardware isnt all that hard to come by on Android phones, so the company is aiming to build an ecosystem of accessories

## DEFCON Conference To Target Voting Machines

- 91284461story DEFCON Conference To Target Voting Machines  (politico.com)   An anonymous reader quotes a report from Politico:  Hackers will target American voting machines -- as a public service, to prove how vulnerable they are

- When over 25,000 of them descend on Caesar's Palace in Las Vegas at the end of July for DEFCON, the world's largest hacking conference, organizers are planning to have waiting what they call "a village" of different opportunities to test how easily voting machines can be manipulated

- Some will let people go after the network software remotely, some will be broken apart to let people dig into the hardware, and some will be set up to see how a prepared hacker could fiddle with individual machines on site in a polling place through a combination of physical and virtual attacks

- With all the attention on Russia's apparent attempts to meddle in American elections -- former President Barack Obama and aides have made many accusations toward Moscow, but insisted that there's no evidence of actual vote tampering -- voting machines were an obvious next target, said DEFCON founder Jeff Moss.

## Two days after WCry worm, Microsoft decries exploit stockpiling by governments

-                   EnlargeStephen Brashear / Getty Images News    Two days after a National Security Agency-derived ransomware worm infected 200,000 computers in 150 countries, Microsoft on Sunday criticized the stockpiling of exploits by government spies, warning it results in damage to civilians.The unusually blunt message from Microsoft President and Chief Legal Officer Brad Smith came after a weekend of tense calm, as security professionals assessed damage from Friday's outbreak and braced themselves for the possibility of follow-on attacks that might be harder to stop

- It also came 24 hours after Microsoft took the highly unusual step of issuing patches that immunize Windows XP, 8, and Server 2003, operating systems the company stopped supporting as many as three years ago.Sunday's salvo tacitly noted the NSA's key role in Friday's attack, which copied almost verbatim large sections of two highly advanced hacking tools that were stolen from the NSA and leaked to the world at large last month by a mysterious group calling itself Shadow Brokers

- In the post, Smith wrote:Finally, this attack provides yet another example of why the stockpiling of vulnerabilities by governments is such a problem

- This is an emerging pattern in 2017

- We have seen vulnerabilities stored by the CIA show up on WikiLeaks, and now this vulnerability stolen from the NSA has affected customers around the world

- Repeatedly, exploits in the hands of governments have leaked into the public domain and caused widespread damage

- An equivalent scenario with conventional weapons would be the U.S

- military having some of its Tomahawk missiles stolen

## WANNACRYPT0R: PATIENT ZERO AND MALWARE EPIDEMIOLOGY

- Continuing on the hot topic of the month I had some thoughts about WannaCrys infection vector and heat maps that I have been seeing all over the place

- I wanted to see who patient zero may be and having played many a game of Pandemic, I thought maybe this approach might yield something of use

- In looking online I found only two heat maps that give a timeline that shows what may be patient zeros location(s) but in doing this research I cam to the conclusion that this may be impossible without the help of all of the AV vendors out there

- When trying to ascertain who may be patient and country zero for this malware it becomes apparent that you have to rely on various vendors who may or may not have seen the malware with their products

- So far I have Malwarebytes timeline and Symantec

- Now, given that Symantec has a larger market share I will go with them for the base assessment of patient zero on Wannacry but if the other vendors want to kick on and give a timeline for each of their products seeing infections I would welcome the data.Since Wannacry traversed the net via SMB attacks (ETERNALBLUE and DOUBLE PULSAR) it may be possible to see just who was infected first and just maybe, get a lock on where that SMB connection came from

- This might help the investigations into who did this at least nominally because one would assume the adversary used a proxy box or some other obfuscation to launch the initial attack... Unless, they are inept n00bs that is, so maybe something could come of this line of investigation

- Anyway, the best timeline(s) I saw were Malwarebytes and Symantec as I said above

## Congress Fast-Tracks Bill That Would Give DHS Agencies Access To NSA Collections

- Patrick G. Eddington of CATO reports a new bill is being quickly and quietly pushed through the House to expand this sharing to several more federal agencies.

- That Congress considers expanded information sharing with domestic security agencies "non-controversial" (hence the sped-up voting process) is an indication of the majority's view of the privacy/security balancing act.

- Eddington quotes from a 2012 report from the Senate Homeland Security Committee, which found DHS Fusion Centers to be expensive, useless, and a harm to the public.

-    The Department of Homeland Security estimated that it had spent somewhere between $289 million and $1.4 billion in public funds to support state and local fusion centers since 2003, broad estimates that differ by over $1 billion.   The investigation found that DHS intelligence officers assigned to state and local fusion centers produced intelligence of uneven quality  oftentimes shoddy, rarely timely, sometimes endangering citizens civil liberties and Privacy Act protections, occasionally taken from already-published public sources, and more often than not unrelated to terrorism.    This is where the NSA's collections will ultimately end up: in the hands of DHS branch offices that do little more than repeatedly screw up.

- Add to that the routine clusterfuck that is the CBP, ICE, and TSA, and you have a recipe for massive Fourth Amendment violations under the pretense of national security.

## Shadow Brokers Launches 0-Day Exploit Subscriptions for $21,000 Per Month

-       As promised to release more zero-days exploits and hacking tools for various platforms starting from June 2017, the infamous hacking group Shadow Brokers is back with more information on how to subscribe and become a private member for receiving exclusive access to the future leaks.  The Shadow Brokers is the same hacking group who leaked NSA's built Windows hacking tools and zero-day exploits in public that led to the WannaCry menace.  When the Shadow Brokers promised its June 2017 release two weeks ago, the group announced that it would sell new zero-day exploits and hacking tools only to the private members with paid monthly subscription, instead of making them public for everyone.   How to Become Member of the 'Wine of Month' Club?  Now, just a few minutes ago, the hacking collective has released details about how to participate in the monthly subscription model  or the "Wine of Month Club," as the group called it  to get exclusive access to the upcoming leaks each month starting from June.  So, those who are interested in buying the membership of the "wine of month club" would require to:   Send 100 ZEC (Zcash), which is around $21,519 USD, to this z_address (zcaWeZ9j4DdBfZXQgHpBkyauHBtYKF7LnZvaYc4p86G7jGnVUq14KSxsnGmUp7Kh1Pgivcew1qZ64iEeG6vobt8wV2siJiq) between 06/01/2017 and 06/30/2017. Include a 'delivery email address' in the 'encrypted memo field' when sending Zcash payment.   Once done, the Shadow Brokers will send a payment confirmation email to "delivery email address" provided by all interested members.  Then between 07/01/2017 and 07/17/2017, the group will send another email to all confirmed members, containing a link and their unique password for the June 2017 data dump.  Launched in late October, Zcash is a new cryptocurrency currency that claims to be more anonymous than Bitcoin, as the sender, recipient, and value of transactions remain hidden.

- TheShadowBrokers not fully trusting TOR either," the Shadow Brokers writes.   What is Going to be in the Next Data Dump?  The hacking collective says the membership has been kept expensive because the data dump has been intended for hackers, security companies, government, and OEMs.  "If you caring about losing $20k+ Euro then not being for you.

- Monthly dump is being for high rollers, hackers, security companies, OEMs, and governments," the Shadow Brokers say. Although what the June dump would contain is not clear at the moment, the Shadow Brokers' last announcement claimed that the upcoming data dump would include:  Exploits for operating systems, including Windows 10. Exploits for web browsers, routers, and smartphones. Compromised data from banks and Swift providers. Stolen network information from Russian, Chinese, Iranian, and North Korean nuclear missile programs.   Keeping in mind the last disaster caused due to the leaked NSA exploits, it would not be wrong if security companies buy the June dump for $21,000 per month and secure their products before hackers get their hands on new zero-day exploits to wreak havoc across the world.  The claims made by the Shadow Brokers remain unverified at the time of writing, but since its previously released dump turned out to be legitimate, the group's statement should be taken seriously, at least now, when we know the NSA's backdoors released by the group last month were used by WannaCry and other malware to cause chaos worldwide.  If the announcement made by the Shadow Brokers comes out to be true, the world should be well prepared for another WannaCry-like massive destroyer.   Shadow Brokers Emptied their Bitcoin Account   Before publicly dumping the stolen NSA zero-day exploits in April, the Shadow Brokers put an auction of those cyber weapons for 1 Million Bitcoin.  Although the auction did not go well, the Bitcoin address setup by the hacking collective to collect bids has received a total of 10.5 Bitcoin (around $24,000).  Finally, on Monday, the Shadow Brokers emptied their Bitcoin account, moving all the Bitcoins to subsidiary Bitcoin addresses.

## Porting Windows Dynamic Link Libraries to Linux

-  Introduction This repository contains a library that allows native Linux programs to load and call functions from a Windows DLL. As a demonstration, I've ported Windows Defender to Linux. $ ./mpclient eicar.com main(): Scanning eicar.com... EngineScanCallback(): Scanning input EngineScanCallback(): Threat Virus:DOS/EICAR_Test_File identified.

- This is especially true for endpoint security products, which use complex interconnected components that span across kernel and user space.

- This allows me to run the code Im testing in minimal containers with very little overhead, and easily scale up testing. This is just personal opinion, but I also think Linux has better tools.

- Mpengine is a vast and complex attack surface, comprising of handlers for dozens of esoteric archive formats, executable packers, full system emulators for various architectures and interpreters for various languages.

- This project is intended to allow native Linux code to load simple Windows DLLs. The closest analogy would be ndiswrapper but for userspace. License GPL2
