## Broadening HSTS to secure more of the Web

- Posted by Ben McIlwain, Google RegistryThe security of the Web is of the utmost importance to Google

- One of the most powerful tools in the Web security toolbox is ensuring that connections to websites are encrypted using HTTPS, which prevents Web traffic from being intercepted, altered, or misdirected in transit

- We have taken many actions to make the use of HTTPS more widespread, both within Google and on the larger Internet.We began in 2010 by defaulting to HTTPS for Gmail and starting the transition to encrypted search by default

- In 2014, we started encouraging other websites to use HTTPS by giving secure sites a ranking boost in Google Search

- In 2016, we became a platinum sponsor of Lets Encrypt, a service that provides simple and free SSL certificates

- Earlier this year we announced that Chrome will start displaying warnings on insecure sites, and we recently introduced fully managed SSL certificates in App Engine

- And today were proud to announce that we are beginning to use another tool in our toolbox, the HTTPS Strict Transport Security (HSTS) preload list, in a new and more impactful way.The HSTS preload list is built in to all major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Internet Explorer/Edge, and Opera)

- It consists of a list of hostnames for which browsers automatically enforce HTTPS-secured connections

## Citrix patches Netscaler hole, ARM TrustZone twisted, Android Dirty COW exploited  and more security fails

- Roundup As ever, it has been a busy week on the security front with good news, some very bad reports, corporate failings all round and troubling signs ahead for those worried about government intrusion in the online world. Here's El Reg's take on the resulting wreckage.  Cloudflare opens up protection  Among the good news, Cloudflare said it will give all customers "Unmetered Mitigation" against DDoS attacks, meaning anyone who subscribes will now get the full protection afforded by the edge network provider, rather than having to pay based on volume of protected traffic. Cloudflare CEO Matthew Prince reasons it's wrong of his firm to charge users based on the size of the person attacking them, or let them get knocked offline because they can't afford to guard against huge volumes. "DDoS attacks are, quite simply, a plague on the Internet and its wrong to surprise customers with higher bills when they are targeted by one," Prince said. "With Unmetered Mitigation, were breaking the industrys practice of surge pricing when someone comes under attack.

- These stole credentials to some of Brazil's most popular banks using fake webpages and keyloggers.  Bugs bork apps n'chips  Citrix said on Monday the Netscaler and SD-WAN issue that prompted it to halt software downloads last week was an authentication bypass in its management interface.

- Usually side-channel attacks need physical access to the target device, but not all the time. Researchers subverted the energy management systems of a Nexus 6 phone and were able to read data moving in TrustZone just by measuring power output.

- The DoJ wants the names of 6,000 people who signed up to an anti-Trump website before the inauguration. A gag order prevented Facebook discussing the case, but The Social NetworkTM fought and won.

- Earlier in the week security blogger Brian Krebs discovered a cache of five million credit cards offered for sale online.

## XSS in a certificate signing request

-    Web application developers will all know, never to trust the input of the users of the web application

- But what if you do not really know what they are submitting?While investigating some form fields in our application, I came across a form for checking a certificate signing request (CSR) witch you need to order a SSL / TLS certificate.A certificate signing request is an encoded file with the information to request a certificate from a certificate authority (CA) or a reseller of that CA

- You will need to create that file yourself and put in the information that you want.So, you can also put something in it like this: script  alert('attacked')  /script u can do an SQL injection if the certificate CA of reseller is saving the information from the CSR to an SQL database for later use.So, let me show you some examples.Note: All the tested websites are informed about this.This is the CSR I used in all the cases:-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE REQUEST-----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-----END CERTIFICATE REQUEST-----You can check the contents of it here:https://cryptoreport.websecurity.symantec.com/checker/views/csrCheck.jspHow did I made that certificate signing request?

## Japanese boffins try 'token passing' to scale quantum calculations  The Register

- Apart from actually performing computations, one of the most difficult quantum computing challenges is getting qubits to scale. A Japanese team has published what it believes is a solution to the problem of scale.

- Quantum gates are complex creatures with many more components than their classical equivalents, so instead of trying to cram enough gates into a small space to perform calculations, the University of Tokyo proposal is to send photons around in a ring, re-using one gate to act on different photons in turn. (By now, greybearded and defeated Token Ring partisans are wiping away nostalgic tears and thinking we were too soon.

- ) If need be, the light pulses can travel around the loop indefinitely, according to professor Akira Furusawa and assistant professor Shuntaro Takeda, who came up with the scheme, without losing the quantum information they carry. Because of this, the pair make a fairly bold claim: This approach potentially enables scalable, universal, and fault tolerant quantum computing, which is hard to achieve by either qubit or CV [continuous variable  El Reg] scheme alone.  The Furusawa/Takeda loop-based quantum architecture  The paper, published at Physical Review Letters and also available at arXiv (PDF), also notes that the scheme is compatible with existing quantum error-correction techniques. In a media release (here) Professor Furusawa says his team is working on automating the error-correction process.

- The release adds that his previous optical-based quantum computing system needed 6.3m2 and 500 mirrors and lenses, and could only handle a single pulse at a time. Furusawa's paper notes that the gate sequence is electrically programmed, making it fast, and it notes that all the basic building blocks of our architecture are already available, meaning the work should be replicable. Furusawa said in the canned statement: "Well start work to develop the hardware, now that weve resolved all problems except how to make a scheme that automatically corrects a calculation error."

- Good luck with that.

## Start Your Engines  Firefox Quantum Lands in Beta, Developer Edition

- For example, weve transformed Firefox to run using multiple processes, striking the just right balance between speed and memory usage.

- One example: weve developed a breakthrough approach to laying out pages: a super fast CSS engine written in Rust, a systems programming language that Mozilla pioneered.

- If youre using Photon on a Windows PC with a touch display, the menus change size based on whether you click with a mouse or touch with a finger. The new, minimalist design introduces square tabs, smooth animations, and a Library, which provides quick access to your saved stuff: bookmarks, Pocket, history, downloads, tabs, and screenshots.

- Firefox Quantum feels right at home with todays mouse and touch-driven operating systems: Windows 10, macOS High Sierra, Android Oreo, and iOS 11.      

- When you open a new tab, youll see currently trending web pages recommended by Pocket users so you wont miss out on whats hot online, as well as your top sites.

## DHS informs 21 states that Russian hackers attacked their voting systems in 2016 election

- The Department of Homeland Security today revealed which states were targeted by Russian hackers trying to break into voting systems during the 2016 election cycle

- DHS said "most" states were unsuccessfully attacked, but didn't make clear how and where the hackers were successful, or whether the sustained cyberattacks helped Donald Trump win the presidency

## How we hacked your AWS Cloud - Rhino Security Labs

- AWS Shortcomings and Security VulnerabilitiesAmazon Web Services (AWS) provides an easy-to-manage cloud platform to store your digital assets, host servers and more

- Its simple client interface in tandem with extensive documentation makes it a popular choice amongst developers to host their applications

- Amazon also has many settings for security controls including firewalls to block incoming and outgoing traffic and different identity and access management (IAM) accounts with varying levels of privileges

- However, misconfigurations in your web application can allow an attacker to pivot into your cloud and exfiltrate both company and consumer data.Application Permissions  Traditional vs AWS OptionsIn the past, developers used hard-coded passwords to access different services, such as MySQL or FTP, to retrieve client data

- Amazon realized this poor security practice and implemented what is called the Amazon Metadata Service

- Instead, when your application wants to access assets, it can query the metadata service to get a set of temporary access credentials

- The temporary credentials can then be used to access your S3 assets and other services

- Another purpose of this metadata service is to store the user data supplied when launching your instance, in-turn configuring your application as it launches.As a developer, you stop reading here  an easily scalable infrastructure with streamlined builds, all of which executing from the command line? Done

## ed25519.nl

- In RFC 8080, ed25519 (and ed448) were standardized for use in DNSSEC in February 2017.This domainname, is DNSSEC signed with this algorithm.Why use ed25519 for DNSSEC signatures?ed25519, as an elliptic curve cryptography(ECC) signature algorithm, offers high security signatures in a small signature size.

- A 256 bit ECC key has similar security properties to 3072 bit RSA signatures (see table 3, page 53 of NIST SP 800-57).As an example, an ed25519 signature is 64 bytes long, compared to 256 bytes for an RSA 2048 signature.

- These smaller signatures ensure that DNS amplification attacks are less severe than before, without sacrificing the security of DNSSEC.So what about EcDSA (also standardized for use in DNSSEC)?

- EcDSA requires random data when signing, this can lead to leaking the private key when bad random data is used.

- ed25519, however, only requires random data when generating the private key.DNS software supporting ed25519This is an incomplete list of DNS tools and servers that support or will support ed25519:BIND 9 (unreleased) has support based on the upcoming OpenSSL 1.1.1Knot DNS (unreleased) will support ed25519 in 2.6 using GnuTLS 3.6.0Unbound (since 1.6.4) supports ed25519 via the unreleased OpenSSL 1.1.1 and since version 1.6.6 via libnettlePowerDNS Authoritative Server (since 4.0.0) has support for signing with ed25519 using libsodiumPowerDNS Recursor (since 4.0.5) has support for validating ed25519 using libsodiumDNS software not supporting ed25519And an incomplete list of tools and servers that do not support ed25519:SIDN, the Dutch registry does not support adding DS records for ed25519 keys since the moment of registration of this domain name (September 23rd 2017)DNSViz, everybody's favorite DNSSEC debugging tool

## CBS's Showtime caught mining crypto-coins in viewers' web browsers

- The hidden software typically consumed as much as 60 per cent of CPU capacity on computers visiting the sites. The scripts were written by Code Hive, a legit outfit that provides JavaScript to website owners: webmasters add the code to their pages so that they can earn slivers of cash from each visitor as an alternative to serving adverts to generate revenue.

- One Monero coin, 1 XMR, is worth about $92 right now. However, it's extremely unlikely that a large corporation like CBS would smuggle such a piece of mining code onto its dot-coms  especially since it charges subscribers to watch the hit TV shows online  suggesting someone hacked the websites' source code to insert the mining JavaScript and make a quick buck. The JavaScript, which appeared on the sites at the start of the weekend and vanished by Monday, sits between HTML comment tags that appear to be an insert from web analytics biz New Relic.

> " The outfit did confirm to us, however, that the email address used to set up the account was a personal one, and was not an official CBS email address, further suggesting malicious activity.  Pirate Bay  Coin Hive's mining code was at the center of some attention last week when file-sharing search engine The Pirate Bay admitted it had added the coin-gathering JavaScript on its pages in order to test its profitability in an effort to get rid of ads on its site. The code was poorly configured  web admins are allowed to set the hashing rate  and resulted in people's machines slowing to a crawl, sparking complaints.

- Following the outcry, The Pirate Bay acknowledged the presence of the mining script, calling it "only a test" and promised to limit the CPU usage to make it less annoying.

- The huge advantage to the website operator using the code is that not only does the script use someone else's processing power but also their electricity, meaning that you can make money with very little effort.

## Saudis Stike Deal to Monitor WhatsApp Calls

- All online voice and video call services - such as Microsofts Skype, Facebooks WhatsApp and Messenger, and Rakutens Viber - that satisfy the kingdoms regulatory requirements, were set to become accessible.

- Asked if the apps could be monitored by the authorities or companies, he said: Under no circumstances can the user use an application for video or voice calling without monitoring and censorship by the Communications and Information Technology Commission, whether the application is global or local. It was unclear how the authorities can monitor apps such as WhatsApp, which says its messages are supported by end-to-end encryption, meaning the company cannot read customers messages even if approached by law enforcement agencies.

- Internet communications have become widespread but Saudi Arabia began blocking them from 2013, wary that such services could be used by activists.

- Zain Saudis CEO, Peter Kaliaropoulos, told Reuters some lost income could be recouped through expansion of its own data services.

- The opportunity to monetize the extra data usage will partially offset voice revenue losses.

## The Great DOM Fuzz-off of 2017

- Posted by Ivan Fratric, Project ZeroIntroductionHistorically, DOM engines have been one of the largest sources of web browser bugs

- And while in the recent years the popularity of those kinds of bugs in targeted attacks has somewhat fallen in favor of Flash (which allows for cross-browser exploits) and JavaScript engine bugs (which often result in very powerful exploitation primitives), they are far from gone

- For example, CVE-2016-9079 (a bug that was used in November 2016 against Tor Browser users) was a bug in Firefoxs DOM implementation, specifically the part that handles SVG elements in a web page

- It is also a rare case that a vendor will publish a security update that doesnt contain fixes for at least several DOM engine bugs.An interesting property of many of those bugs is that they are more or less easy to find by fuzzing

- This is why a lot of security researchers as well as browser vendors who care about security invest into building DOM fuzzers and associated infrastructure.As a result, after joining Project Zero, one of my first projects was to test the current state of resilience of major web browsers against DOM fuzzing.The fuzzerFor this project I wanted to write a new fuzzer which takes some of the ideas from my previous DOM fuzzing projects, but also improves on them and implements new features

- Starting from scratch also allowed me to end up with cleaner code that Im open-sourcing together with this blog post

- The goal was not to create anything groundbreaking - as already noted by security researchers, many DOM fuzzers have begun to look like each other over time

- Instead the goal was to create a fuzzer that has decent initial coverage, is easily understandable and extendible and can be reused by myself as well as other researchers for fuzzing other targets besides just DOM fuzzing.We named this new fuzzer Domato (credits to Tavis for suggesting the name)

## New System Knows How Hard Youre Thinking Based on Thermal Imaging

-  Imagine that you, a science journalist, have sat down to write a blog post about some cool new technology that's also pretty complicated and esoteric.

- In response, it adjusts your music, puts your browser into a focus mode, and, should the thought-sprint persist for too long or become too extreme, suggests taking a five minute break.

-   I don't really know if any of that would be helpful to me personally, but the authors of a new study published in the  Proceedings of the ACM on Interactive, Mobile, Wearable and Ubiquitous Technologies imagine real utility in a system capable of detecting how hard you're thinking, aka cognitive load.

- Basically, imagine a phone that not only scans your face but looks at what's  behind your face as well in the form of a heatmap.  "[Cognition-aware] systems offer opportunities to tailor educational activities in online learning environments, to dynamically optimize workflows for knowledge, to improve performance for assembly line workers, and to focus users' attention in critical systems," the study explains.

> "A crucial step in building cognition-aware systems is capturing different aspects of users' mental states, such as their cognitive load, loci of attention, and affect.

## Duck-Assisted Code Execution in EMC Data Protection Advisor

- Unfortunately, the vendor chose not to patch this bug since it needs a helping hand to get that code execution.

- Fortunately (for attackers), other bugs in the product combined with an ill-tempered water fowl provide all the help needed.

- Luckily, rgod also discovered ZDI-17-710 (CVE-2017-8002), a blind SQL injection vulnerability that will allow the attacker to obtain these IDs.

- Combining these three vulnerabilities, rgod beautifully crafted a multi-staged PoC to achieve code execution as SYSTEM.

-  Conclusion This selection of bugs discovered by rgod has demonstrated how attackers can combine multiple non-RCE vulnerabilities in a target to eventually achieve total system compromise.

## Signal >> Blog >> Technology preview: Private contact discovery for Signal

- For people to be able to use software like Signal, they have to know how to contact their friends and colleagues using Signal.This raises two related concerns:Building a social graph isnt easy.

- Signal is always aspiring to be as zero knowledge as possible, and having a durable record of every users friends and contacts on our servers would obviously not be privacy preserving.Almost all social software has to deal with the first problem.

- Memory access patterns should always look the same for all outcomes, with care and attention similar to constant time programming considerations in cryptographic software.Using the oblivious hash table construction method above, we can put together a general recipe for doing private contact discovery in SGX without leaking any information to parties that have control over the machine, even if they were to attach physical hardware to the memory bus:The contact discovery service passes a batch of encrypted contact discovery requests to the enclave.The enclave decrypts the requests and uses the oblivious hash table construction process to build a hash table containing all submitted contacts.The enclave iterates over the list of all registered users.

- For each registered user, the enclave indexes into the hash table containing the batch of client contacts and does a constant-time comparison against every contact in that cache line.The enclave writes to the results cache line for that same hash index, regardless of whether there was a successful compare or not.After iterating through the entire set of registered users, the enclave builds an oblivious response list for each client request in the batch.The enclave encrypts the appropriate response list to each requesting client, and returns the batch results to the service.The service transmits the encrypted response back to each requesting client.By pushing the inefficiencies into the setup and teardown sections of batch processing, the critical section remains fast enough for the entire process to scale to over a billion users.Oblivious limitationsThe OS is still capable of learning minor things from careful observation.

- This is a beta technology preview, but well be deploying the service into production and integrating it into clients as we finish testing over the next few months.AcknowledgmentsHuge thanks to Jeff Griffin for doing the heavy lifting and writing all the enclave code, Henry Corrigan-Gibbs for introducing us to SGX, Raluca Ada Popa for explaining ORAM state of the art to us, and Nolan Leake for systems insight.

## The Tiny, $25 PocketBone

-         It was announced a day or two ago, but now the PocketBeagle has made its first real-world appearance at the World Maker Faire in New York this weekend

- This is a tiny, tiny Linux computer thats small enough to fit on a keychain, or in an Altoids mini tin

- Its only $25 USD, and from the stock lists on Mouser and Digikey, there are plenty to go around.The specs for the PocketBeagle are more or less exactly what you would expect from any BeagleBone

- Theres an ARM Cortex-A8 running at 1GHz, 512 MB of RAM, and SD card storage

- I/O is eight analog inputs, up to 44 digital GPIOs, up to 3 UARTs, 2 I2C busses, 2 SPI busses, and 4 PWM outputs

- All of this is packed into the OSD3358 System on a Chip from Octavo Systems.This isnt the first time weve seen Octavo Systems BeagleBone on a Chip  Before the release, head Beagle herder [Jason Kridner] built a PocketBone in Eagle, which was shortly followed by [Michael Welling]s similar efforts in KiCad

- The PocketBeagle has been a reality for months, but now its accessible to hackers who dont want to deal with soldering BGA packages.This version of the PocketBeagle is getting close to as Open Source as you can get, with the design files available in Eagle and KiCad

- One interesting feature of the PocketBeagle is which pins, busses, and peripherals are enabled by default

## Equifax fooled again! Company tweets out links to parody website

-                                 You'd have thought that Equifax staff would be on their toes ever since the megahack that exposed the private data of over 143 million Americans but the corporation's social media certainly haven't got the message.                When news of the hack was published on September 7, over a month after its scale had been discovered, Equifax set up a website for worried customers to check if they had been affected  equifaxsecurity2017.com  rather than setting it up on the equifax.com domain.                As a bit of fun security researcher Nick Sweeting set up securityequifax2017.com with a familiar look and feel, just like phishers do every day

- To make that point the headline on the website was "Cybersecurity Incident  Important Consumer Information which is Totally Fake, why did Equifax use a domain that's so easily impersonated by phishing sites?"                Turns out he had a point, since the site fooled Equifax itself

- Shortly after setting up the site, Equifax's official Twitter feed started to link to Sweeting's fake page and in a series of posts dating from September 9 Tim on Equifax's social media team began tweeting out the wrong URL to customers concerned about their data.                Seriously, Tim?                The tweets (now removed by red-faced Equifax staff) continued until Sept 18 before they were spotted by stanleyspadowski on imgur and @aaronkkruse on Twitter

- It's not known how many people were directed to the site, and it has since been blocked by Google.                I'm now on the Chrome domain blacklist

- Not particularly motivated to change the domain, so for now these screenshots are the legacy

- https://t.co/Iznla9UvfK Nick Sweeting  (@thesquashSH) September 20, 2017                You might think that, given the long time Equifax had to prepare for the hacking announcement, it would have been on the ball

- But instead the emergency website it set up for consumers to check their status was a slapdash job, it tried (and failed) to indemnify itself against litigation with legal trickery and took nearly a week to confirm how many UK citizens were caught up in the event.                The entire hack was possible because the company wasnt patching promptly, having left an Apache Struts flaw unpatched for months  although Equifax is not alone in that

- The company's CSO and CIO have since retired, presumably with a nice golden parachute, and the CFO and other senior management's share sales are being investigated.                Given that Equifax is trying desperately to avoid a full-scale investigation into its business practices, you'd have thought the company would have been more on the ball

## Technical Interview Performance by Editor, OS, and Language

- My co-worker Daniel is really into Emacs

- Its his primary editor, his grocery list (via org-mode), and #4 of the 6 things he cant live without on his OkCupid profile

- Other engineers in the office, however, prefer Vim (or Sublime Text, or even RubyMine)

- Naturally, this leads to war

- But after months of salvos (VimGolf one-upmanship, gratuitous references to this Stack Overflow question) no clear victor has emerged.So last week, I set out to see what the Triplebyte data has to say on the issue

- Take this with a grain of salt (correlation does not imply causation), but there is a correlation between what editor an engineer uses, their language and OS, and their ability to pass programming interviews

- And, according to our data, Vim users pass interviews at a rate ever-so-slightly higher than Emacs users! [1]About the DataAt Triplebyte we evaluate hundreds of engineers every week

- Each interview involves talking to one of our interviewers (like me!) over Google Hangouts

## Deloitte hit by cyber-attack revealing clients secret emails

- Deloitte provides auditing, tax consultancy and cybersecurity advice to banks, multinational companies and government agencies.Photograph: Alamy Stock PhotoOne of the worlds big four accountancy firms has been targeted by a sophisticated hack that compromised the confidential emails and plans of some of its blue-chip clients, the Guardian can reveal.Deloitte, which is registered in London and has its global headquarters in New York, was the victim of a cybersecurity attack that went unnoticed for months.One of the largest private firms in the US, which reported a record $37bn (27.3bn) revenue last year, Deloitte provides auditing, tax consultancy and high-end cybersecurity advice to some of the worlds biggest banks, multinational companies, media enterprises, pharmaceutical firms and government agencies.The Guardian understands Deloitte clients across all of these sectors had material in the company email system that was breached

- The companies include household names as well as US government departments.So far, six of Deloittes clients have been told their information was impacted by the hack

- Deloittes internal review into the incident is ongoing

- The Guardian understands Deloitte discovered the hack in March this year, but it is believed the attackers may have had access to its systems since October or November 2016.The hacker compromised the firms global email server through an administrators account that, in theory, gave them privileged, unrestricted access to all areas.The account required only a single password and did not have two-step verification, sources said.Emails to and from Deloittes 244,000 staff were stored in the Azure cloud service, which was provided by Microsoft

- This is Microsofts equivalent to Amazon Web Service and Googles Cloud Platform.  Microsofts Azure cloud service

- Photograph: MicrosoftIn addition to emails, the Guardian understands the hackers had potential access to usernames, passwords, IP addresses, architectural diagrams for businesses and health information

- Some emails had attachments with sensitive security and design details.The breach is believed to have been US-focused and was regarded as so sensitive that only a handful of Deloittes most senior partners and lawyers were informed. The Guardian has been told the internal inquiry into how this happened has been codenamed Windham

- It has involved specialists trying to map out exactly where the hackers went by analysing the electronic trail of the searches that were made.The team investigating the hack is understood to have been working out of the firms offices in Rosslyn, Virginia, where analysts have been reviewing potentially compromised documents for six months.It has yet to establish whether a lone wolf, business rivals or state-sponsored hackers were responsible.Sources said if the hackers had been unable to cover their tracks, it should be possible to see where they went and what they compromised by regenerating their queries

## Google Subjects Top 5 Browsers to 100 Million Fuzz Tests

- Adobe Flash and more recently JavaScript vulnerbilities have been key targets, but there's another attack vector not talked about as much: the DOM. The Document Object Model (DOM) is basically what a web browser relies on to take HTML and turn it into what end users see on their screen.

- A fuzzer is an automated tool that feeds random data into a piece of software and then monitors it for unexpected behavior, memory leaks, and crashes. Domato was used to assess the current top five browsers: Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer, Edge, and Safari.

- Typically it's Internet Explorer we expect to be the least secure web browser, but when it comes to the DOM, Apple's Safari is by far and away the worst performing.

- Fratric concludes his write-up of the tests by saying, "DOM engines have been one of the largest sources of web browser bugs.

- With Flash slowly disappearing, there could certainly be more focus on trying to exploit weaknesses in DOM engines in the future. The Domato fuzzer is available to use and the results of this test are now public, so hopefully browser developers will take note and deal with the highlighted bugs.

## This fake finger could help make our fingerprint scanners more secure

-   Scientists have created a more realistic fake finger that they hope will help them improve fingerprint ID technology

- Fingerprint ID is almost ubiquitous now, but they remain the phones biggest security vulnerability

- Fake fingers already exist, but researchers at Michigan State University have created a more advanced version that can be used to test fingerprint scanners and make them harder to hack

- A technical report detailing the process has been submitted to arXiv, a repository of non-peer-reviewed papers

- The paper will also appear later in the journal IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security.Its not too difficult to create fake fingers to hack a phone

- Researchers at CITER have done this using 3D-printed molds developed from an image

- At the CCC conference in 2014, a security researcher called Starbug used a high-res photo of the German defense ministers hand to create a working model

- Study author Anil Jain has long worked on these biometric issues

## Apple makes it harder to track you online, ad industry has an aneurysm

- Safari has blocked third-party cookies (used to track your behavior across multiple websites) since 2010, but the ad-tech industry has fired back with a bunch of covert tracking tools that watch you even if you've adopted privacy countermeasures; the latest version of Safari goes one better, deploying machine-learning to selectively block even more tracking technologies, while still preserving useful third-party cookies that help you stay logged in and do useful work across different sites.In response, the ad-tech industry has staged a(nother) tantrum, claiming that Apple is "destroying the Internet's economic model."Adblocking is the largest consumer revolt in history, driven by ad-tech's creepy surveillant overreach

- Since its earliest years, the web has experienced an ebb-and-flow of intrusive ads, driven by users and tech companies who gave them tools to block ads

- When browsers like Opera and Mozilla started blocking pop-up ads by default, users adopted them in droves, and then advertisers stopped insisting on placing pop-ups on publishers' sites, because these ads just never showed up on users' computers.Browsers like Brave go even farther than Safari, while still offering a middle path: replacing surveillant ads with non-tracking ads, offering publishers a share of the take, so publishers still get paid when their readers choose to block tracking

- The new Safari update, with Intelligent Tracking Protection, closes loopholes around third-party cookie-blocking by using machine learning to distinguish the sites a user has a relationship with from those they dont, and treating the cookies differently based on that

- When you visit a site, any cookies that are set can be used in a third-party context for twenty-four hours

- During the first twenty-four hours the third-party cookies can be used to track the user, but afterward can only be used to login and not to track

- This means that sites that you visit regularly are not significantly affected

- The companies this will hit hardest are ad companies unconnected with any major publisher.At EFF we understand the need for sites to build a successful business model, but this should not come at the expense of people's privacy

## Deloitte is a sitting duck: Key systems with RDP open, VPN and proxy 'login details leaked'

-                                 Mondays news that multinational consultancy Deloitte had been hacked was dismissed by the firm as a small incident.                Now evidence suggests it's no surprise the biz was infiltrated: it appears to be all over the shop, security wise.                On Tuesday, what seemed to be a collection of Deloitte's corporate VPN passwords, user names, and operational details were found lurking within a public-facing GitHub-hosted repository

- These have since been removed in the past hour or so

- In addition, it appears that a Deloitte employee uploaded company proxy login credentials to his public Google+ page

- The information was up there for over six months  and was removed in the past few minutes.                We were tipped off to these pages by an eagle-eyed reader, and grabbed a couple of screenshots of the potentially offending data:                Screenshot of some of the alleged VPN details for accessing Deloitte's network that leaked onto GitHub  we've censored what looks like passwords                                 Screenshot of a portion of the Google+ page with Deloitte proxy login information                On top of these potential leaks of corporate login details, Deloitte has loads of internal and potentially critical systems unnecessarily facing the public internet with remote-desktop access enabled

- All of this gear should be behind a firewall and/or with two-factor authentication as per industry best practices

- And likely the best practices Deloitte recommends to its clients, ironically.                Just in the last day Ive found 7,000 to 12,000 open hosts for the firm spread across the globe, security researcher Dan Tentler, founder of Phobos Group, told The Register today

- Were talking dozens of business units around the planet with dozens of IT departments showing very different aptitude levels

- The phrase truly exploitable comes to mind.                For example, he found a Deloitte-owned Windows Server 2012 R2 box in South Africa with RDP wide open, acting as what appears to be an Active Directory server  a crucial apex of a Microsoft-powered network  and with, worryingly, security updates still pending installation

## China Blocks WhatsApp, Broadening Online Censorship

- The restrictions on video, audio chats and file sharing were at least temporarily lifted after a few weeks.WhatsApp now appears to have been broadly disrupted in China, even for text messages, Nadim Kobeissi, an applied cryptographer at Symbolic Software, a Paris-based research start-up, said on Monday.

- Next months meeting is expected to reconfirm President Xi Jinpings nearly absolute grip on power, but considerable uncertainty remains over who will join him on the Standing Committee of the Politburo, the partys highest-ranking group.Over the past several years, China has not only stepped up censorship but also closed numerous churches and jailed large numbers of human rights activists, lawyers and advocates for ethnic minorities.The shutdown of WhatsApp prompted considerable dismay on Chinese social media.Losing contact with my clients, forced back to the age of telephone and email for work now, one user complained on Weibo, a Twitter-like microblogging site.

- The messaging service, which has 963 million active users, bears some similarities to WhatsApp but has a wider array of features and one crucial difference: close ties to the government.

- The trade office has not said whether the inquiry will include the blocking of products that rely on American intellectual property, or whether it will focus more narrowly on cases in which China has allegedly purloined or otherwise copied it.WhatsApp has a strong reputation among cryptographers for security, which may have been what drew the attention of Chinese censors.

- A version of this article appears in print on September 26, 2017, on Page B3 of the New York edition with the headline: China Blocks WhatsApp, Tightening Its Online Grip.

## NBD: Adobe just dumped its PRIVATE PGP key on the internet

-                                 Updated An absent-minded security staffer just accidentally leaked Adobe's private PGP key onto the internet.                The disclosure was spotted by security researcher Juho Nurminen  who found the key on the Photoshop giant's Product Security Incident Response Team blog, ironically

- That contact page should have only included the public PGP key.                Oh shit Adobe pic.twitter.com/7rDL3LWVVz Juho Nurminen (@jupenur) September 22, 2017                Adobe has not returned a request for comment on the matter, possibly because it has slightly more pressing concerns at the moment

- Namely, key rotation and internal public-private key education

- It has also torn down its private key from the security blog.                It goes without saying that the disclosure of a private security key would, to put it mildly, ruin a few employees' Friday

- Armed with the private key, an attacker could spoof PGP-signed messages as coming from Adobe

- Additionally, someone (cough, cough the NSA) with the ability to intercept emails  such as those detailing exploitable Flash security vulnerability reports intended for Adobe's eyes only  could use the exposed key to decrypt messages that could contain things like, say, zero-day vulnerability disclosures.                Armed with that info, miscreants could exploit that information to infect victims with malware before Adobe had even considered deploying a patch.                On the other hand, PGP isn't exactly known for being a user-friendly system, and the process of intercepting and decrypting messages would be difficult to do before the keys are changed.                While very embarrassing for Adobe, the likelihood this will lead to any sort of catastrophic incident is fairly low, especially if the key is only being used for email

- Still, it's rather clumsy

- We're all only human after all

## Signals Moxie Marlinspike calls out Telegram founder Pavel Durov

- Onstage at TechCrunch Disrupt SF 2017, Signals at times elusive privacy revolutionary Moxie Marlinspike spoke modestly about how his secure text message app is taking over the world.Marlinspike directly addressed the controversy that Telegram Messenger founder Pavel Durov stirred up earlier this year when he basically accused Signal of collaborating with the U.S

- government.Pavel Durov wants to frame privacy as a question of trust

- He has this sort of Trump logic that only billionaires can be trusted because they cant be bought, Marlinspike said.The encryption of Signal (=WhatsApp, FB) was funded by the US Government

- I predict a backdoor will be found there within 5 years from now. Pavel Durov (@durov) June 8, 2017During our team's 1-week visit to the US last year we had two attempts to bribe our devs by US agencies + pressure on me from the FBI. Pavel Durov (@durov) June 11, 2017Weve received very little attention from law enforcement, Marlinspike said when asked how often government agencies come knocking, an event that Durov claims is a frequent occurrence

- Weve only ever received one subpoena and we published the full request.Marlinspike reiterated that the whole point of end-to-end encryption is that users no longer need to trust anyone if the protocol works  and Signal does

- He remained open about the fact that Signal received a grant from the U.S

- governments Open Technology Fund, which he notes is at least a few degrees removed from American intelligence operations, leaving him far from beholden to any three-letter agencies.By all accounts, Durovs accusation is bogus

- Signals open protocol, implemented now in products by companies like Facebook and Google, is still regarded as robust across the security community

## Gitlab 10.0 released

-    From the formulation of an idea to executing and monitoring it in production, DevOps establishes a culture and environment where developing, testing, and releasing software can happen quickly, frequently, and more reliably. GitLab 10.0 delivers a hands-free DevOps environment with the introduction of , allowing your team to easily configure and adopt modern development practices in your workflow.

- This is achieved not only by indicating the total time it takes to reach that point, but the total time is broken down into the multiple stages an idea has to pass through to be shipped. With thanks to our community contributor, Mehdi Lahmam it is now possible to view your cycle over a seven-day period which is great for teams with very short release cycles.     Read through the documentation on Cycle Analytics     New GitLab Runner Repository       At 12th September 2017 weve moved GitLab Runner to a new repository path.

- Note that discussions on lines that dont change and top-level resolvable discussions are not automatically resolved. Thank you Ashley Dumaine for the contribution.     Read through the documentation on GitLab Discussions     LDAP Group Sync Improvements for External Users      LDAP Group Sync is available in GitLab Enterprise Edition and provides a great hassle-free way to manage user permissions by leveraging your existing LDAP group system and permissions. GitLab further supports external users allowing more restrictive control on projects on a case-by-case basis. In GitLab 10.0 synchronizing external user permissions will happen at login, in addition to the existing periodic synchronization.

- If you would like to continue to accept TLSv1 connections, it can be added back to the list of supported protocols by editing the nginx['ssl_protocols'] field in gitlab.rb.  Due: September 22nd, 2017.    GitLab Git HTTP Server Configuration Support Removed  Since GitLab 8.2, we have used gitlab-workhorse to process Git HTTP traffic.

- However, its insecure as there are no per-gitlab-user access controls on use of the key.  Due: September 22nd, 2018.    Drop Support of Legacy Git Storage Configuration  With the release of GitLab 9.0, we changed how to configure an alternate Git storage directory in order to support multiple directories.

## W3C abandons consensus, standardizes DRM, EFF resigns

-  In July, the Director of the World Wide Web Consortium overruled dozens of members' objections to publishing a DRM standard without a compromise to protect accessibility, security research, archiving, and competition.

-    Dear Jeff, Tim, and colleagues, In 2013, EFF was disappointed to learn that the W3C had taken on the project of standardizing Encrypted Media Extensions, an API whose sole function was to provide a first-class role for DRM within the Web browser ecosystem.

- It would help protect new market entrants intent on creating competitive, innovative products, unimagined by the vendors locking down web video. Despite the support of W3C members from many sectors, the leadership of the W3C rejected this compromise.

- The W3C leadership countered with proposals  like the chartering of a nonbinding discussion group on the policy questions that was not scheduled to report in until long after the EME ship had sailed  that would have still left researchers, governments, archives, security experts unprotected. The W3C is a body that ostensibly operates on consensus.

- We'll keep suing the US government to overturn the laws that make DRM so toxic, and we'll keep bringing that fight to the world's legislatures that are being misled by the US Trade Representative to instigate local equivalents to America's legal mistakes. We will renew our work to battle the media companies that fail to adapt videos for accessibility purposes, even though the W3C squandered the perfect moment to exact a promise to protect those who are doing that work for them. We will defend those who are put in harm's way for blowing the whistle on defects in EME implementations. It is a tragedy that we will be doing that without our friends at the W3C, and with the world believing that the pioneers and creators of the web no longer care about these matters. Effective today, EFF is resigning from the W3C. Thank you, Cory Doctorow Advisory Committee Representative to the W3C for the Electronic Frontier Foundation

## Trump Orders Removal of Kaspersky Products from Federal Systems

- The president cites concern that the Russia-based company could be influenced by the Kremlin.President Trump instructed all federal departments and agencies to purge Kaspersky Lab products and services from their information systems, marking the latest blow to the Russian cybersecurity company. Trump issued his order citing concerns that the Kremlin could influence Kaspersky Lab, according to a Reuters report.

- Within the next 30 days, all federal agencies are required to identify Kaspersky products and services on their systems, and within 90 days remove these products and services and discontinue their future use, according to a statement from the US Department of Homeland Security.

> "The risk that the Russian government, whether acting on its own or in collaboration with Kaspersky, could capitalize on access provided by Kaspersky products to compromise federal information and information systems directly implicates U.S. national security.

- The company, in a statement, says: "Kaspersky Lab has never helped, nor will help, any government in the world with its cyberespionage or offensive cyber efforts, and it's disconcerting that a private company can be considered guilty until proven innocent, due to geopolitical issues.

## DRM now a formal Web recommendation after protest vote fails

-                                 Anti-piracy and anti-copying protections are now formally part of the World Wide Web after an effort to vote down content controls at the WWW's standards body failed.                The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) has been embroiled in controversy for five years over the introduction of the Encrypted Media Extensions (EME) specification

- It finally went to a vote and was approved by 58.4 per cent, with 30.8 per cent opposed and the rest abstaining.                Some argue that a so-called digital rights management standard is needed so browsers have a common way to make sure that things like copyrighted videos are protected uniformly across the web

- The EME technology  championed by Netflix, Microsoft, Google and others  is designed to stop people saving, copying and sharing copies of movies and other high-quality stuff streamed online without permission.                Meanwhile, others have been fiercely opposed to the DRM mechanisms on principle: contending that the W3C should only ever create standards that promote an open internet.                The argument has also laid bare a rift in the standards body between internet engineers who see themselves as the guardians of the internet's open philosophy, and corporate interests who have increasing sway over the W3C.                The tipping point likely came in the form of web inventor Tim Berners Lee who, as director of the W3C, argued in March for the inclusion of EME, having long tried to steer clear of the controversy.                "W3C is not the US Congress, or WIPO, or a court," he argued

> "W3C is a place for people to talk, and forge consensus over great new technology for the web

- Yes, there is an argument made that in any case, W3C should just stand up against DRM [digital rights management], but we, like Canute, understand our power is limited."                Berners-Lee noted that EME would promote greater interoperability and enable the data provided by content use to be limited, improving online privacy.                  Defeatist                But critics were not persuaded, criticizing the W3C and Berners-Lee for their "defeatist" attitudes and for selling out to commercial interests

- They argued that the proposal will "give corporations the new right to sue people who engaged in legal activity." Three formal objections to the proposal were launched:                It does not provide adequate protection for usersIt will be hard to include in free softwareIt doesn't legally protect security researchers                After some back-and-forth and a few minor changes, the EME recommendation moved forward to a vote and was passed.                The decision sparked a considerable effort by the W3C to argue its case

- CEO Jeff Jaffe wrote a blog post in which he argued that the debate over EME wasn't actually about W3C standards, so much as a societal shift.                "W3C did not create DRM and we did not create DMCA

- DRM has been used for decades prior to the EME debate," he wrote." But in recent years it is a credit to the World Wide Web that the web has become the delivery vehicle for everything, including movies

## Worlds first quantum-cryptographic satellite network is likely to be Chinese

- IN THE never-ending arms race between encryptors and eavesdroppers, many of those on the side that is trying to keep messages secret are betting on quantum mechanics, a description of how subatomic particles behave, to come to their aid.

- Experiments conducted recently, by Pan Jianwei, a physicist at the University of Science and Technology of China, in Hefei, have shown that it can.The keys to the high castleSuch tests have been made possible by the launch, in August 2016, of Micius, the worlds first quantum-communication satellite.

- A series of such changes on successively transmitted photons can carry information, provided a code has been agreed on in advance.To minimise the amount of atmosphere in the way, and thus the risk of signal disruption, Dr Pan and his team put their ground station for this experiment in Ngari, a region of south-western Tibet that has an altitude of 5,100 metres.

- The altitude Dr Pan has in mind is 20,000km, which will permit the satellite to communicate simultaneously with a much bigger part of Earths surface and allow him to test the feasibility of building a practical quantum-communications network.

- If all this goes well, the ultimate goal is a world-spanning ring of satellites in geostationary orbits.One question Dr Pan and his colleagues particularly want to answer with their next experiments is whether entanglement is affected by a changing gravitational field.

## Google Pixelbook Is Googles New Chromebook

-         As we noted in our earlier Google Home Mini reveal, a report from a couple of weeks back had actually suggested that Google would soon release a smaller Home unit

- In that same report, it was suggested that a new high performance Chromebook Pixel was on the way too

- Today, we can confirm that report and you can all welcome in the Google Pixelbook.Yep, Pixelbook is the official name, which kind of makes sense since the line used to be called Chromebook Pixel, yet Google appears to be ready to fully embrace the Pixel branding for hardware

- Or does that make sense? I cant decide, but am looking forward to the explanation on October 4.The Pixelbook will come in Silver, along with 128GB, 256GB, and 512GB storage options

- The prices will look familiar to those who remember the original two Chromebook Pixel devices, in that they arent coming cheap like many of the other Chromebooks sold by Samsung, Acer, etc

- The 128GB version will start at $1,199, followed by the 256GB model at $1,399 and the 512GB option at $1,749.This Pixelbook is different from previous Chromebook Pixel units in that it folds into a tablet

- Itll also get additional interactivity, thanks to the official Pixelbook Pen, which will cost $99

- The Pixebool Pen is pressure sensitive, with tilt support and supposedly no lag.Once live, you should be able to buy the Pixelbook here and the Pixelbook Pen here.Related:And Here is the Pixel 2 XL in Black and White, Starting at $849Here is the Pixel 2 in Kinda Blue, White, and Black  Starting at $649Here is the New Google Daydream View, Itll Cost $99Here is the Google Home Mini, the Smaller $49 Google Home

## iTerm2: Please disable 'Perform DNS lookups to check if URLs are valid'

- What happened: iTerm sent various things (including passwords) in plain text to my ISP's DNS server

- I monitored my DNS traffic for a while, and I kept noticing lookups that made no sense, for things that had been printed to my terminal.

- Having this feature on by default is a terrible security and privacy risk.

- I personally never even noticed the blue vs. white on clickable links, which suggests (n=1) that usability will not be reduced that much by setting this feature disabled by default.

- And, to stress the impact, in the act of selecting text and Cmd-C'ing it to Copy, it is very easy to trigger this for passwords (for example, when I generate them using pwgen).

## Automotive Grade Linux Platform Debuts on the 2018 Toyota Camry

- More than 100 members are working together to develop a common platform that can serve as the de facto industry standard.

- This ultimately reduces development costs, decreases time-to-market for new products and reduces fragmentation across the industry. The flexibility of the AGL platform allows us to quickly roll-out Toyotas infotainment system across our vehicle line-up, providing customers with greater connectivity and new functionalities at a pace that is more consistent with consumer technology, said Keiji Yamamoto, Executive Vice President, Connected Company of Toyota Motor Corporation.

- They have been a driving force behind the development of the AGL infotainment platform, and we are excited to see the traction that its gaining across the industry. The AGL infotainment platform was built from the ground up by hundreds of engineers across the industry who contributed code to develop a robust, Linux-based operating system and application framework with increased security and capabilities.

- Toyota actively contributes code back to the AGL platform and will be sharing additional code as their next-generation infotainment system is rolled out.  About Automotive Grade Linux (AGL) Automotive Grade Linux is a collaborative open source project that is bringing together automakers, suppliers and technology companies to accelerate the development and adoption of a fully open software stack for the connected car.

- Although initially focused on In-Vehicle-Infotainment (IVI), AGL is the only organization planning to address all software in the vehicle, including instrument cluster, heads up display, telematics, advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and autonomous driving.

## What the NSA Collects via 702

- What the NSA Collects via 702        New York Times reporter Charlie Savage writes about some bad statistics we're all using:Among surveillance legal policy specialists, it is common to cite a set of statistics from an October 2011 opinion by Judge John Bates, then of the FISA Court, about the volume of internet communications the National Security Agency was collecting under the FISA Amendments Act ("Section 702") warrantless surveillance program

- In his opinion, declassified in August 2013, Judge Bates wrote that the NSA was collecting more than 250 million internet communications a year, of which 91 percent came from its Prism system (which collects stored e-mails from providers like Gmail) and 9 percent came from its upstream system (which collects transmitted messages from network operators like ATT).These numbers are wrong

- This blog post will address, first, the widespread nature of this misunderstanding; second, how I came to FOIA certain documents trying to figure out whether the numbers really added up; third, what those documents show; and fourth, what I further learned in talking to an intelligence official

- This is far too dense and weedy for a New York Times article, but should hopefully be of some interest to specialists.Worth reading for the details

## Kaspersky shrugs off government sales ban proposal

-                                 Kaspersky Lab has laughed off attempts to have its wares banned from US government computers by saying it hardly sold to the Feds anyway.                Given that U.S

- government sales have not been a significant part of the companys activity in North America, Kaspersky Lab is exploring opportunities to better optimize the Washington D.C

- office responsible for threat intelligence offerings to U.S

- government entities, the company says in a statement.                The statement goes on to say that North America remains a strategic market for Kaspersky Lab

- So strategic, in fact, that it plans to open offices in Los Angeles, Chicago and Toronto Canada during 2018.                Expanding the companys presence in the region will better enable Kaspersky Lab to provide its customers with the best cybersecurity solutions and services, the statement said.                Company founder Eugene Kaspersky's Tweeted take on the topic is below.

- Best Buy did not link its decision to US Senator Jeanne Shaheen's attempt to have Kaspersky banned on government computers, but didn't explain it either.                Senator Shaheen argued for the ban on grounds that Kaspersky products chat to servers in Russia, which she characterises as a hostile country

- That allegation is made possible by findings that Russia interfered in the United States 2016 election season, spreading misinformation and possibly abetting hackers of the Democratic National Congress and/or making sure the results of that heist made it to Wikileaks.                Vendors have survived this sort of thing before: Huawei remains forbidden from selling to the US and Australian governments, but its consumer handset business is doing very well in both markets and its enterprise business is a contender in many industries

-

## AWS announces per-second billing for EC2 instances

- When Amazon launched the AWS EC2 cloud computing service back in 2006, per-hour billing was a big deal, but that scheme also meant that youd pay for a full hour even if you only used an instance for a few minutes

- Over the last few years, AWSs competitors moved to more flexible billing models (mostly per-minute billing) and now, starting October 2, AWS is one-upping many of them by moving to per-second billing for its Linux-based EC2 instances.This new per-second billing model will apply to on-demand, reserved and spot instances, as well as provisioned storage for EBS volumes

- Amazon EMR and AWS Batch are also moving to this per-second model

- its worth noting, though, that there is a one-minute minimum charge per instance and that this doesnt apply to machines that run Windows or some of the Linux distributions that have their own separate hourly charges.In a world where serverless platforms like AWS Lambda are quickly taking off  and which features sub-second billing  the old per-hour model surely didnt make much sense to a lot of developers

- But theres also the simple fact that EC2 has gotten a bit of a reputation for being expensive, especially as Google, Microsoft and others moved to per-minute billing.

## Apple says Face ID didnt actually fail during its iPhone X event

-                   EnlargeApple    The first public demo of Apples Face ID phone unlocking system didnt go exactly as planned.During the companys big iPhone X reveal this week, Apple software engineering chief Craig Federighi suffered a semi-cringeworthy moment when he was unable to unlock the new handset onstage using the new authentication tech

- The device prompted Federighi to use a passcode instead, leading him to switch to a backup unit, which worked properly.The mishap led some to immediately doubt the effectiveness of the Face ID setupwhich completely replaces the usual Touch ID fingerprint scanner on the iPhone Xand, according to some reports, even led to a brief dip in Apples share price.Now, though, Apple is trying to reassure onlookers that Face ID didnt actually misbehave

- According to a report from Yahoos David Pogue, an Apple representative chalked the miscue up to staffers who had touched the device prior to the demo.People were handling the device for stage demo ahead of time and didnt realize Face ID was trying to authenticate their face, the Apple rep reportedly said in a statement

- After failing a number of times, because they werent Craig, the iPhone did what it was designed to do, which was to require his passcode

- Face ID worked as it was designed to.Its hard to say if this is exactly what happened with 100 percent confidence, but Apples explanation does appear plausible

- Apples developer documentation says Face ID locks out Phone users and prompts them to use a passcode after only two unsuccessful unlocking attempts

- (Touch ID, by comparison, asks for a passcode after five unsuccessful attempts.)Regardless of the onstage mishap, Face ID will still face plenty of questions going forward

- Apple, for its part, says Face ID will be significantly more secure than Touch ID and that any facial recognition data will be stored on the iPhone itself

## Tor 0.3.2.1-alpha is released, with support for next-gen hidden services and KIST scheduler

- The second new scheduler type is called "KISTLite": it behaves the same as KIST, but runs on systems without kernel support for inspecting TCP implementation details.

- ) Matt Traudt implemented KIST, based on research by Rob Jansen, John Geddes, Christ Wacek, Micah Sherr, and Paul Syverson.

- Fixes bug 22885; bugfix on 0.2.3.4-alpha. Avoid unnecessary calls to directory_fetches_from_authorities() on relays, to prevent spurious address resolutions and descriptor rebuilds.

- Closes ticket 22608. Remove dead code for largely unused statistics on the number of times we've attempted various public key operations.

- Closes ticket 22215. Rename the obsolete malleable hybrid_encrypt functions used in TAP and old hidden services, to indicate that they aren't suitable for new protocols or formats.

## Equifax CIO, CSO Step Down

- Embattled credit-monitoring company names interim replacements for both positions and outlines more details about the massive breach.Equifax late today announced that its chief information officer and chief security officer were "retiring" and "effective immediately.

- She will be replaced by Russ Ayres, who most recently served as vice president in its IT department. Equifax said it first observed suspicious network traffic on July 29 that appeared to come from its US online dispute portal Web application.

- The security team then took the affected Web application offline. When Equifax drilled deeper into the problem, it found a vulnerability in the Apache Struts Web application framework (CVE-2017-5638), and determined that flaw was the initial attack vector. "Upon discovering a vulnerability in the Apache Struts web application framework as the initial attack vector, Equifax patched the affected web application before bringing it back online," Equifax stated. The Apache Struts patch for the flaw was first made available in early March. "Equifax's Security organization was aware of this vulnerability at that time, and took efforts to identify and to patch any vulnerable systems in the company's IT infrastructure," Equifax stated.

> "While Equifax fully understands the intense focus on patching efforts, the company's review of the facts is still ongoing.

## ISO Rejects NSA Encryption Algorithms

- The ISO has decided not to approve two NSA-designed block encryption algorithms: Speck and Simon.

- A number of them voiced their distrust in emails to one another, seen by Reuters, and in written comments that are part of the process.

- The suspicions stem largely from internal NSA documents disclosed by Snowden that showed the agency had previously plotted to manipulate standards and promote technology it could penetrate.

- More than a dozen of the experts involved in the approval process for Simon and Speck feared that if the NSA was able to crack the encryption techniques, it would gain a "back door" into coded transmissions, according to the interviews and emails and other documents seen by Reuters.

- "I don't trust the designers," Israeli delegate Orr Dunkelman, a computer science professor at the University of Haifa, told Reuters, citing Snowden's papers.

## Spanish police raid .Cat domain name registry offices

- Raid is part of crackdown on Catalonia independence referendum.As reported on DomainIncite and InternetNews.me overnight U.S

- time, Spanish police have raided the offices of Fundacio puntCAT, the registry operator for the .cat domain name..Cat is a domain name for the Catalonia region and people that speak Catalan.Spanish authorities asked the registry to block domain names that were being used to spread information about an upcoming referendum for independence

- puntCAT sent this letter to ICANN earlier this week to advise it about what was happening:We have denounced to @ICANN the disproportionate action of the courts

- Committed to freedom on the Internet

- pic.twitter.com/NkvTMYJ79d Fundacio puntCAT (@puntcat) September 17, 2017Spanish authorities have raided the office and apparently taken some computers

- According to InternetNews.me, they also arrested the groups CTO

- Its unclear what arrested means in these circumstances.There are over 100,000 .cat domain names registered

- The ongoing operations should not be affected because puntCAT uses a third-party registry services provider, and because of the distributed nature of DNS

## FireEye pulls Equifax boasts as it tries to handle hack fallout


- Criminals had access to names, social security numbers, birth dates, addresses and, in some instances, drivers license numbers of millions of Americans as well as the credit card numbers of 209,000 US consumers.                Early indications are that hackers failed to go even deeper and access Equifaxs core consumer or commercial credit reporting databases

- Equifax said that hackers exploited an unspecified web application vulnerability to hack into its systems.                Equifax has reportedly hired incident response experts at FireEye Mandiant to investigate the breach

- These experts have also been helping with PR aspects of damage limitation, it seems

- Brandan Schondorfer of Mandiant registered the domain Equihax.com on Tuesday (5 September), two days before the breach was publicly disclosed, thereby preventing anyone else intent on poking fun at Equifax  or perhaps worse, run phishing attacks  from getting their hands on the domain.                Other aspects of Equifaxs overall incident response (analysed in depth in a post by security blogger Guise Bule here) have been less assured

- For example, security experts at Sophos have criticised Equifaxs use of PINs  based on the date and time of when a request was made  to freeze consumer credit files

- Crooks have a far better chance of determining these PINs and unfreezing credit files than if they were randomly generated

- Worse yet, compromised server logs might be used to determine PINs

## Equifax Has Been Sending Consumers to a Fake Phishing Site for Almost Two Weeks

- Photo: APEquifaxs response to its data breach has been a total shitshow, something the company seems determined to remind us of each and every day.For nearly two weeks, the companys official Twitter account has been directing users to a fake lookalike website, the sole purpose of which is to expose Equifaxs reckless response to the breach.After announcing the breach, Equifax directed its customers to equifaxsecurity2017.com, a website where they can enroll in identity theft protection services and find updates about how Equifax is handing the cybersecurity incident. But the decision to create equifaxsecurity2017 in the first place was monumentally stupid

- The URL is long and it doesnt look very officialthat means its going to be very easy to emulate

- Fake versions of the site could be used to phish Equifax customers and steal their personal information, again

- A much safer choice would have been to create a subdomain on the Equifax website (equifax.com) and direct users there.To illustrate  how idiotic Equifaxs decision was, developer Nick Sweeting created a fake website of his own: securityequifax2017.com

- (He simply switched the words security and equifax around.) Sweetings website looks slightly different than the official Equifax website, as you can see below, but only because he isnt actually trying to dupe anyone: Fake Equifax breach-response site created by Nick Sweeting

- Sweetings intentions clearly arent malicious

- If anything, hes trying to demonstrate why Equifax needs to shut down its website, or at least transfer it elsewhere, so it isnt further exposing consumers to risk.As if to demonstrate Sweetings point, Equifax appears to have  been itself duped by the fake URL

- The company has directed users to Sweetings fake site sporadically over the past two weeks

## First Linux 4.14 release adds "very core" features, arrives in time for kernel's 26th birthday | ZDNet

-                                                                                         Image: Aalto University/YouTube                                        Linus Torvalds has announced the first release candidate (rc) for Linux 4.14, the next long term stable release of the Linux kernel

- This release introduces several new core memory management features, a host of device driver updates, and changes to documentation, architecture, filesystems, networking and tooling

- It's the first of a likely seven release candidates before the new kernel reaches stable release around November

- Torvalds announced the Linux 4.14rc on Saturday, exactly one day before Linux-0.01 -- the very first kernel then coded largely by Torvalds himself -- was released 26 years ago

- Today, there are some 4,300 developers working on the kernel, adding around 10,000 lines of code per day

- Kernel maintainer Greg Kroah-Hartman said earlier this month that Linux 4.14 would be this year's long term support kernel, meaning he'll be adding stable kernel patch back ports for at least two years from its release

- This was announced in July

- Previous long term releases were 4.4 and 4.9, which are supported until February 2018, and January 19, respectively

## Chrome to label FTP sites insecure

-                                 Google's Chrome browser will soon label file transfer protocol (FTP) services insecure.                Google employee and Chrome security team member Mike West yesterday announced the plan on the Chromium.org security-dev mailing list.                As part of our ongoing effort to accurately communicate the transport security status of a given page, we're planning to label resources delivered over the FTP protocol as 'Not secure'.                We didn't include FTP in our original plan, West wrote, referring to the decision to mark HTTP as insecure

- Adding FTP to Chrome's naughty list was decided upon because its security properties are actually marginally worse than HTTP (delivered in plaintext without the potential of an HSTS-like upgrade)

- Given that FTP's usage is hovering around 0.0026% of top-level navigations over the last month, and the real risk to users presented by non-secure transport, labelling it as such seems appropriate.                As we noted when covering Debian's decision to dump its FTP archive, the protocol was published in 1971

- Age alone doesn't make it a bad protocol, but it was designed for gentler times

- It's therefore hard to disagree with Google's decision.                West points out that the Linux Kernel archive has also binned FTP, with ftp://ftp.kernel.org/ taken offline on March 1st, 2017, in favour of HTTPS

-

## Pepe the Frogs Creator Goes Legally Nuclear Against the Alt-Right

> " Tompros and team have also gone after alt-right figure Baked Alaska, serving cease and desist letters to him and DMCA notices to Amazon, Twitter and his other online social media spaces.

- Meme Magic is currently not available on Amazon.com, but a used copy was for sale on Amazon.co.uk at the time of publishing. "Google Play has stopped selling his  Build the Wall: The Game for the same reason.

- Stamping out the multiple vendors peddling Pepe mech on Amazon will be difficult, but the team has already succeeded in removing several shirts from the market, including the one worn by Morris May when he pepper sprayed a transgender activist in early September.

-  Amazon, Reddit, Twitter, Google, YouTube, Mike Cernovich, Baked Alaska, and Richard Spencer did not immediately respond to request for comment. DMCA takedowns have become a popular way for media companies to strike back against social media influencers they don't like for a variety of reasons, including reasons that go beyond mere copyright infringement.

## Title PassGAN A Deep Learning Approach for Password Guessing

- Cornell UniversityLibraryWe gratefully acknowledge support fromthe Simons Foundation and member institutionsarXiv.org  cs  arXiv:1709.00440 Full-text links:Download:PDFOther formats(license)Current browse context:cs.CRChange to browse by:cscs.LGstatstat.MLReferences  CitationsNASA ADSBookmark (what is this?)Computer Science  Cryptography and SecurityTitle:PassGAN: A Deep Learning Approach for Password Guessing(Submitted on 1 Sep 2017)Abstract: State-of-the-art password guessing tools, such as HashCat and John the Ripper(JTR), enable users to check billions of passwords per second against passwordhashes

- In addition to straightforward dictionary attacks, these tools canexpand dictionaries using password generation rules

- Although these rulesperform well on current password datasets, creating new rules that areoptimized for new datasets is a laborious task that requires specializedexpertise.In this paper, we devise how to replace human-generated password rules with atheory-grounded password generation approach based on machine learning

- Theresult of this effort is PassGAN, a novel technique that leverages GenerativeAdversarial Networks (GANs) to enhance password guessing

- PassGAN generatespassword guesses by training a GAN on a list of leaked passwords

- Because theoutput of the GAN is distributed closely to its training set, the passwordgenerated using PassGAN are likely to match passwords that have not been leakedyet

- PassGAN represents a substantial improvement on rule-based passwordgeneration tools because it infers password distribution informationautonomously from password data rather than via manual analysis

- As a result,it can effortlessly take advantage of new password leaks to generate richerpassword distributions.Our experiments show that this approach is very promising

## Optionsbleed - HTTP OPTIONS method can leak Apache's server memory | The Fuzzing Project

- The server answers with the "Allow" header and gives us a comma separated list of supported methods.  A scan of the Alexa Top 1 Million revealed something strange: Plenty of servers sent out an "Allow" header with what looked like corrupted data.

- And if one sets the Limit directive in an .htaccess file for an HTTP method that's not globally registered in the server then the corruption happens.

- Setting a Limit directive for any invalid HTTP method in an .htaccess file caused a use after free error in the construction of the Allow header which was also detectable with Address Sanitizer.

- (However ASAN doesn't work reliably due to the memory allocation abstraction done by APR.

- This can leak pieces of arbitrary memory from the server process that may contain secrets.

## Hacker Can Steal Data from Air-Gapped Computers Using IR CCTV Cameras

- Air-gapped computers that are isolated from the Internet and physically separated from local networks are believed to be the most secure computers which are difficult to infiltrate.However, these networks have been a regular target in recent years for researchers, who have been trying to demonstrate every possible attack scenarios that could compromise the security of such isolated networks.Security researchers from Ben-Gurion University in Israel have previously demonstrated several ways to extract sensitive information from air-gapped computers.Now, the same University researchers have discovered another way to steal confidential information from air-gapped computers  this time with the help of infrared-equipped CCTV cameras that are used for night vision.Researchers have developed a new attack scenario, dubbed aIR-Jumper, which includes an infected air-gapped computer (from which data needs to be stolen) and an infected CCTV network (that has at least one CCTV installed inside the premises facing the infected computer and one outside the premises), assuming that both networks are isolated from each other, and none of them is Internet-connected.Ignoring the fact that how an air-gapped computer and CCTV network got infected with malware in the first place, the new research focused on, once infected, how the malware would be able to transfer the stolen data back to the attackers (waiting outside the premises).To read and send data, the aIR-Jumper malware installed on air-gapped computer and CCTV network blink IR LEDs in morse-code-like patterns to transmit files into the binary data, i.e

- 0 and 1.The data from a video camera can be transmitted at 20 bits per second to an attacker at a distance of tens of meters away and from an attacker to a video camera at 100 bits per second, even in total darkness.Since the attack is meant to steal files in binary data, attackers wouldnt be able to steal any large files but could get their hands on passwords, cryptographic keys, PIN codes and other small bits of sensitive data stored on the targeted computer."In an infiltration scenario, an attacker standing in a public area (e.g., in the street) uses IR LEDs to transmit hidden signals to the surveillance camera(s)," the researchers say

> "Binary data such as command and control (CC) and beacon messages are encoded on top of the IR signals."The researchers also published two videos demonstration, showing two attack scenarios.In the first video, the researchers demonstrated how the malware installed on the air-gap computer collected data, converted it into binary and then blinked LED accordingly

- At the same time, the infected camera captured this pattern and the malware installed on the camera converted the morse-code back into the binary data.In the second video, another internally-connected camera installed outside the premises (in the parking area) transmitted the stolen binary data to the attackers sitting in the car using IR LED in morse-code-like patterns.Attackers can simply capture the blink of the CCTV using their own camera and can decrypt the data later.Here the infected CCTV camera is working as a bridge between the air-gapped computer and the remote attackers, offering a bi-directional covert channel.It's not the first time Ben-Gurion researchers came up with the technique to target air-gapped computers

- Their previous research of hacking air-gap computers include:USBee attack that can be used steal data from air-gapped computers using radio frequency transmissions from USB connectors.DiskFiltration attack that can steal data using sound signals emitted from the hard disk drive (HDD) of the targeted air-gapped computer;BitWhisper that relies on heat exchange between two computer systems to stealthily siphon passwords or security keys;AirHopper that turns a computer's video card into an FM transmitter to capture keystrokes;Fansmitter technique that uses noise emitted by a computer fan to transmit data; andGSMem attack that relies on cellular frequencies.For more details on the latest aIR-Jumper attack, you can head onto the paper [PDF] titled, 'aIR-Jumper: Covert Air-Gap Exfiltration/Infiltration via Security Cameras  Infrared (IR).'Mohit KumarEntrepreneur, Hacker, Speaker, Founder and CEO  The Hacker News and The Hackers Conference.

## Introducing Keybase Teams

-     A BIG DAY FOR KEYBASE!Today we're launching the alpha of Keybase teams

- It's the most important project in Keybase's history, and it brings together all of our work.        The basic ideaA Keybase team is a named group of people, with flexible membership

- Let's say you work on a project called Treehouse

- You could register treehouse on Keybase

- This team name is universal; there can be only one Keybase team with a given name.Teams get chats and channels

- The chat looks a bit like Slack or Discord:                    But Keybase teamwork is end-to-end encrypted, which means you don't have to worry about server hacks

- Alternatively, you can lie awake at night...fearing a breach of your company's messaging history

- What if your team's history got stolen from Slack and leaked or published? The legal and emotional nightmare.Also, Keybase accounts are simpler; you don't have to switch at the top level of the app

## Court OKs Barring High IQs for Cops

-   A man whose bid to become a police officer was rejected after he scored too high on an intelligence test has lost an appeal in his federal lawsuit against the city.

-  This kind of puts an official face on discrimination in America against people of a certain class, Jordan said today from his Waterford home.

- I maintain you have no more control over your basic intelligence than your eye color or your gender or anything else.  He said he does not plan to take any further legal action.

- He sued the city, saying his civil rights were violated because he was denied equal protection under the law.

-  But the U.S. District Court found that New London had shown a rational basis for the policy. In a ruling dated Aug. 23, the 2nd Circuit agreed.

## Malware identified in CCleaner 5.33

- It includes functionality such as cleaning of temporary files, analyzing the system to determine ways in which performance can be optimized and provides a more streamlined way to manage installed applications.    Figure 1: Screenshot of CCleaner 5.33  On September 13, 2017 while conducting customer beta testing of our new exploit detection technology, Cisco Talos identified a specific executable which was triggering our advanced malware protection systems.

- In any event, once the previously mentioned system information has been collected and prepared for transmission to the C2 server, the malware will then attempt to transmit it using an HTTPS POST request to 216[.]126[.]225[.]148.

- The requests also leverage HTTPS but ignore all security errors as the server currently returns a self-signed SSL certificate that was issued to the subdomain defined in the Host header field.

- It is important to note that according to the CCleaner download page, the free version of CCleaner does not provide automated updates, so this might be a manual process for affected users.  In analyzing DNS-based telemetry data related to this attack, Talos identified a significant number of systems making DNS requests attempting to resolve the domains associated with the aforementioned DGA domains.

- Cisco Talos continues to monitor all aspects of the threat landscape to quickly identify new and innovative techniques used by attackers to target organizations and individuals around the world.

## Experiments with Matrix for the Purism Librem5, starring Ubports and Nheko | Matrix.org

- So in a shameless attempt to whet everyones appetite and encourage everyone to fund the remaining 50%, we thought wed share some of the experiments weve been doing with running native Matrix clients on a pure Linux phone. Unfortunately the Librem5 doesnt exist yet, but we do happen to have an BQ Aquaris E5 Ubuntu Phone hanging around  so we wondered: Is it possible to run a native desktop Matrix client like mujxs Nheko on a Linux phone, given all the latest Qt voodoo?

- In the end, we focused on solving the Qt problem: building a custom Qt 5.9 for Ubports (the community project who do a fantastic job of continuing Ubuntu Touch development since Canonical pulled out), while for simplicity building it on top of the current ubports distribution (which is effectively still Ubuntu 15.04).

- The reason for all this Ubuntu stuff rather than using PureOS is simply that its not far enough along, and we dont physically have a Librem5 dev kit yet to play with! In practice, this has been a fascinating process: setting up a crosscompiler to build all of Qt5.9, and then porting the ubuntumirclient Qt Platform Abstraction to work with Qt5.9, as well as (finally) working out how to build a Qt5.9-compatible custom Maliit input context platform plugin to get the onscreen keyboard (OSK) up and running.

- A versioned copy of this lives over at this gist. Thanks for reading, and dont forget to preorder! Matthew Recipe: Librem5 experiments with an Ubuntu Phone and Nheko Starting point: one old BQ Aquaris E5 ubuntu phone, running some old version of Ubuntu Touch which had got completely stuck (UI only unfreezing for 2-3 seconds every 2-3 minutes). Step one: flash to latest UBPorts image:  Set up Ubuntu desktop as a host (as per https://docs.ubuntu.com/phone/en/devices/installing-ubuntu-for-devices)  sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-sdk-team/ppa sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get install ubuntu-device-flash sudo apt-get install phablet-tools   Grab an adb-compatible recovery image (yes, seems like the right place is someones personal webspace...)  wget http://people.canonical.com/~jhm/barajas/recovery-vegetahd.img   If your Ubuntu desktop is running in a VM, make sure you have USB 2.0 or 3.0 support enabled (in Virtualbox this needs the extension pack installed).

- # grab the right dev headers (as qtubuntu needs dbus  atspi support) ssh phablet@phone "sudo apt-get install libdbus-1-dev libatspi2.0-dev libssl-dev"

## CLKSCREW: Exposing the perils of security-oblivious energy management

-  CLKSCREW: Exposing the perils of security-oblivious energy management Tang et al., USENIX Security 17 This is brilliant and terrifying in equal measure.

- By probing the device by stepping through voltage and frequency ranges until it either reboots or freezes, the authors demonstrate large areas beyond the official operating performance points where the regulators can be configured:   Attack enabler #1: There are no safeguard limits in the hardware regulators to restrict the range of frequencies and voltages that can be configured.

-  In the figure above we can see that reducing the operating voltage simultaneously lowers the minimum required frequency needed to induce a fault in an attack (push the system above the blue line).

- Heres a plot over 13K executions:  A grid search finds the faulting frequency and duration that induce erroneous AES decryption results.

- Selecting one of the factorizable N_s the authors embed an attack signature into the _widevine trustlet and conduct CLKSCREW faulting attempts while invoking the self-signed app.

## Trip to world beard competition ends in arrest for alleged dark web drug dealer

- Photograph: Instagram/Vallerius   United States authorities arrested a suspected dark web drug dealer as he traveled into the country from his home in France to attend the World Beard and Moustache Championships. Gal Vallerius, a French 38-year-old with a magnificent red beard, is accused of being a drug kingpin on the dark web, acting as an administrator for Dream Market, a marketplace for illegal narcotics including cocaine, heroin and methamphetamines, counterfeit consumer goods and stolen data. Vallerius was arrested as he landed at Atlanta international airport on 31 August, and during a border search of his laptop confirmed his identity as OxyMonster, the username for a Dream Market account that was not only listed as an administrator for the site but also listed prescription drugs including OxyContin and Ritalin for sale.

- Officials also discovered about $500,000 in bitcoins, the currency used for anonymously trading on the marketplace. The arrest, first reported by the Miami Herald, was the culmination a multi-agency investigation that started in February 2016.

- As part of the investigation, Drug Enforcement Administration agents made undercover purchases of crystal meth, LSD and hydrocodone from a range of vendors on Dream Market and trawled the site to identify the usernames associated with the organising team. OxyMonster knowingly participated in the Dream Market conspiracy not only as a vendor, but also in a leadership and organizational role as a senior moderator and administrator, court documents state. 

- They then tracked down his Instagram and Twitter accounts to compare the writing style with that of OxyMonster and discovered many similarities including the use of the word cheers, frequent quotation marks and intermittent French posts, according to court documents filed in Florida. His trip to the beard contest was Valleriuss first time in the United States.

-  Bryan Nelson, the co-founder of the Austin Facial Hair Club, which hosted this years championships, described the arrest as pretty dramatic.

## South Korea bans all new cryptocurrency sales

-  South Korea's financial regulator on Friday said it will ban raising money through all forms of virtual currencies, a move that follows similar restrictions in China on initial coin offerings.

- The Financial Services Commission said all kinds of initial coin offerings (ICO) will be banned as trading of virtual currencies needs to be tightly controlled and monitored.

- The decision to ban ICOs as a fundraising tool was made as the government sees such issues as increasing the risk of financial scams.

- The decision tracks similar announcements in the U.S. and China where increasing trading volumes of cryptocurrencies are sparking concerns.

- It added Friday's announcement doesn't mean the government has implicitly accepted trading of virtual currencies as part of its financial system, and will continue to monitor markets to see additional regulations are needed.

## Accused NSA leaker called America 'the worst thing to happen on the planet'

- A woman suspected of leaking U.S. secrets to a news organization claimed she stuffed a classified report into her pantyhose and walked out of a National Security Agency office in Georgia, mainly because she hates America "like three times a day.

- Reality Winner, 25, told FBI agents she was disappointed in her job as a government contractor, court records show.

- Yeah, I screwed up royally, Winner, told the agents in a transcript that makes public the details of her confession, which prosecutors have alluded to in prior court hearings.

- Winner faces up to 10 years in federal prison if shes convicted on charges that she printed a classified U.S. report and mailed it to an online news outlet.

- Winner told the FBI she was frustrated at her civilian contractor job, which involved translating documents from Farsi to English for the NSA in Augusta, Georgia, where the federal agency has facilities.

## Signal taps up Intel's SGX to (hopefully) stop contacts falling into hackers, cops' hands

- Now its developers have decided to toughen it up even more to avoid the possibility of it being turned against its users. Signal prides itself on being secure for netizens by taking the bare minimum of information from them to function  but it does need access to your contacts to reveal who is messaging or calling.

> " To avoid hashes falling into the wrong hands, Signal is using technology from Intel  specifically its Software Guard Extensions aka SGX.

- This should stop cops taking over a machine and keeping it running to inspect the incoming hashes. The contacts are also stored in an "oblivious" hash table: an inefficient data structure that, hopefully, prevents snoopers from deducing its contents and layout.

- After iterating through the entire set of registered users, the enclave builds an oblivious response list for each client request in the batch.

- There have been proof-of-concept hacks that could break the system, so OWS is taking extra precautions  particularly by observing memory access patterns to divine the data it is parsing.

## Mac High Sierra hijinks continue: Nasty apps can pull your passwords

-                                 A security shortcoming in earlier versions of OS X has made its way into macOS High Sierra despite an expert's best efforts to highlight the flaw.                Patrick Wardle, of infosec biz Synack, found that unsigned, and therefore untrustworthy, applications running on High Sierra, aka macOS 10.13, were able to quietly access sensitive information  including stored passwords and keys  without any notification to the user

- Normally, apps, even signed trusted ones, trigger a prompt to appear on screen when touching the operating system's Keychain database of saved passphrases and other secrets.                In a short video, Wardle showed how his proof-of-concept unsigned app was able to lift the highly personal information on an updated High Sierra Mac

- Wardle said he provided Apple the software and details of the flaw earlier this month, but a fix could not be deployed in time for this week's official High Sierra release

- Wardle said a patch is likely in the works.                Still, the researcher reckoned the app should serve as a note of caution to anyone who regularly installs and runs applications downloaded from the internet on their Mac

- Even legitimate apps, he noted, could possibly be compromised to exploit the vulnerability.                "Obviously, random apps should not be able to access the entire keychain and dump things like plaintext passwords," Wardle explained this week

> "In fact, even signed Apple utilities (ie, /usr/bin/security) that are designed to legitimately access the keychain explicitly require user approval; or most authenticate (with the user's password) before they are allowed to retrieve sensitive keychain data."                This is not the first time the Synack researcher has poked holes in Apple's handling of software permissions

- In 2015, Wardle was credited with discovering weaknesses that would let an attacker circumvent the security protections in Apple's app checker, the OS X Gatekeeper.                This is also not the first major security hole to be uncovered in the day-old High Sierra macOS.                Last week, as the OS was nearing its formal release, Wardle revealed that a flaw in the Security Kernel Extension Loading (SKEL) security tool allowed its protections to be easily bypassed, potentially leaving users vulnerable to low-level infections such as rootkits.                It goes without saying that macOS users should avoid running unsigned applications, and disable their execution from the system control panel

- Essentially, the take-home here is: don't run unsigned apps

## Analyzing Cybersecurity's Fractured Educational Ecosystem

- This means that when employers are trying to find usable guidance, rankings, or even certifications to assist in determining the quality of an academic program, and by proxy, the students and job candidates they produce, they're out of luck. The problem stems from the origins of security in academia.

- As a result, these designations act more like a minimum barrier to entry in the area of infosec education and don't provide a comparative criterion or any mapping to job functions.

- Faculty quality, extracurricular activities, and continuous communication within the industry, including internships, are all contributing factors to the overall student experience and their ultimate success within a program.

- This is where that infosec employer can find their edge; while most companies won't be able to provide the grants and scholarships that the government does, they have the opportunity to serve as advisers to academic programs offering their feedback in exchange for mutually beneficial, hands-on internships.

## GDS - Blog - Reviewing Ethereum Smart Contracts

-                                     Ethereum has been in the news recently due to a string of security incidents affecting smart contracts running on the platform

- As a security engineer, these stories piqued my interest and I began my own journey down the rabbit hole that is Ethereum dapp (decentralized application) development and security

- I think it is a fascinating technology with some talented engineers pushing the boundaries of what is possible in an otherwise trustless network

- The community has also begun to mature, as projects have started bug bounties, security best practices have been published, and vulnerabilities in the technology itself have been patched.Still, if Ethereums popularity is to continue to grow, I believe that it is going to need the help of the wider security industry

- And therein is a problem

- Most security engineers still dont know what Ethereum even is, let alone how to perform a security review of an application running on it.As it turns out, there are some pretty big similarities between traditional code review and Ethereum smart contract review

- This is because smart contracts are functionally just ABI (application binary interface) services

- They are similar to the very API services that many security engineers are accustomed to reviewing, but use a binary protocol and set of conventions specific to Ethereum

## KSK Rollover Postponed

- Based on the estimated number of Internet users who use DNSSEC validating resolvers, an estimated one-in-four global Internet users, or 750 million people, could be affected by the KSK rollover. The changing or "rolling" of the KSK Key was originally scheduled to occur on 11 October, but it is being delayed because some recently obtained data shows that a significant number of resolvers used by Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and Network Operators are not yet ready for the Key Rollover.

- The availability of this new data is due to a very recent DNS protocol feature that adds the ability for a resolver to report back to the root servers which keys it has configured. There may be multiple reasons why operators do not have the new key installed in their systems: some may not have their resolver software properly configured and a recently discovered issue in one widely used resolver program appears to not be automatically updating the key as it should, for reasons that are still being explored. ICANN is reaching out to its community, including its Security and Stability Advisory Committee, the Regional Internet Registries, Network Operator Groups and others to help explore and resolve the issues. In the meantime, ICANN believes it prudent to follow its process and to delay the changing of the key rather than run the risk of a significant number of Internet users being adversely affected by the changing of the key.

- ICANN is committed to continuing its education, communication and engagement with the relevant technical organizations to ensure readiness for the key change. "The security, stability and resiliency of the domain name system is our core mission.

- ICANN's Office of the Chief Technology Officer says it is tentatively hoping to reschedule the Key Roll for the first quarter of 2018, but that it will be dependent on more fully understanding the new information and mitigating as many potential failures as possible. ICANN will provide additional information as it becomes available and the new Key Roll date will be announced as appropriate. "It's our hope that network operators will use this additional time period to be certain that their systems are ready for the Key Roll," said Marby.

- In response to these threats, the international standards organization, IETF, developed DNSSEC to cryptographically ensure DNS content cannot be modified from its source without being detected.

## Dildon'ts of Bluetooth: Pen test boffins sniff out Berlin's smart butt plugs

- The tech has support for security but it's rarely implemented in practice, as El Reg has noted before. The shortcoming allowed boffins at Pen Test Partners to hunt for Bluetooth adult toys, a practice it dubbed screwdriving, in research that builds on its earlier investigation into Wi-Fi camera dildo hacking earlier this year. BLE devices also advertise themselves for discovery.

> " The only protection is that BLE devices will generally only pair with one device at a time and their range is limited. By walking down a regular Berlin street with a Bluetooth sniffer, a PTP researcher was able to discover a number of Lovense sex toys, identifiable from their identifiers, through passive reconnaissance. Mischievous hackers could go easily go one step further and turn on the device using commands easily derived from an examination of the kit. The associated app causes the Hush to start vibrating when the handle 0x000e has "Vibrate:5" written to it. A hacker "could drive the Hush's motor to full speed, and as long as the attacker remains connected over BLE and not the victim, there is no way they can stop the vibrations."

- Ooh err missus. PTP concludes that it has identified a legitimate privacy issue which deserves public attention and red faces all round.

> "They have BLE in them to allow you to play back music, but also control and adjust their settings (like if you're in a noisy restaurant or a concert hall).

- The potential privacy issues this throws up might be mitigated by using a generic BLE device name for, ahem, adult toys and other kit people might not necessarily want world+dog to stumble on. In some ways the development of Bluetooth technology is making the risk more severe. The specification for Bluetooth 4.0 allows for only one concurrent master and slave connection at once, so a device can't be hijacked once it is paired with a smartphone.

## Patch alert! Easy-to-exploit flaw in Linux kernel rated 'high risk'  The Register

- A flaw has been found in the way the Linux kernel loads ELF files. If a malicious program is built as a Position Independent Executable (PIE), the loader can be exploited to map part of that application's data segment over the memory area reserved for its stack.

- Just run your usual package management tools to install the patched kernels and reboot. Red Hat warned: "An unprivileged local user with access to SUID (or otherwise privileged) PIE binary could use this flaw to escalate their privileges on the system.

- The Linux distro rates attack complexity as "low" but impact "high"  always a bad combination. The flaw represents a possible mechanism for a hacker or other malicious party to step up from a normal user to root  e.g. you get a shell as an ordinary user via a compromised web application or another internet-facing service, and then use the above bug to take full control of the box.

- It can also be abused by logged-in users to gain administrative access over the machine. Patching is straightforward, in this case, but deployment is the "hard" part as it'll involve a reboot.

- This flaw does not fall into that category, fortunately. Sysadmins are nonetheless advised to review the security of their systems and patch or at least mitigate against the vulnerability at their earliest opportunity.

## Android users rejoice! Linux kernel LTS releases are now good for 6 years

-                     A major change in the maintenance lifecycle of Linux kernels is coming

- During a Linaro Connect 2017 presentation on Android's Project Treble, Googler Iliyan Malchev announced that Linux LTS (Long Term Support) kernels were switching from a two-year lifecycle to a whopping six years of support.The free and open source Linux kernel powers most of the devices around us

- It's not only present in computers and servers, it also powers most of the ARM devices on earth, so it's present in Android devices, the Internet of things, and almost anything else you can call "smart." Major new versions of the Linux kernel arrive about every 70 days

- Not everyone wants to upend their existing system every 70 days to upgrade to the new kernel, though, so to help with this, the Linux kernel has traditionally had a "Long Term Support (LTS)" kernel, which is supported for two years

- Rather than do a major kernel bump, devices can keep running an LTS kernel and regularly get bug and security fixes, which aren't as disruptive as full releases.Two years of support is fine for some computers, but it's not really enough time in the world of ARM devices, and especially in the world of Android

- For Android, Google grabs a Linux LTS kernel and changes it into the "Android Common" kernel

- This can then go to an SoC vendor like Qualcomm, which modifies it to work on a particular SoC

- Then an OEM like Samsung can take this and build it into a phone

## Government Contractor Offers Million Dollar Bounty for Tor 0-Days - Deep Dot Web

- A cybersecurity company has offered bounties of up to 1 million US dollars for Tor Browser 0-day vulnerabilities

- Zerodiums Tor 0-day bounty program is open until November 30th at 6pm Eastern, or until Zerodium terminates the program after having issued 1 million dollars for Tor 0-days

- The company has stated that it plans to sell these zero day exploits to government agencies, such as law enforcement agencies

- In the United States, zero day exploits have been hoarded and used by intelligence agencies such as the NSA and the CIA

- Earlier this year the government dropped charges against child pornography suspects when the FBI decided to not disclose a zero day exploit it was using against the Tor network.While Tor network and Tor Browser are fantastic projects that allow legitimate users to improve their privacy and security on the internet, the Tor network and browser are, in many cases, used by ugly people to conduct activities such as drug trafficking or child abuse

- We have launched this special bounty for Tor Browser zero-days to help our government customers fight crime and make the world a better and safer place for all, Zerodium writes in their FAQ for the Tor 0-Day Bounty program

- Zero day vulnerabilities that would require control or manipulation of Tor nodes as well as exploits/attacks that would cause disruption of legitimate use of the Tor network will not be accepted by Zerodium.The exploit must be capable of being deployed through a simple web page, and must attack the current stable release and experimental release of the Tor Browser

- The exploit must not require any interaction from a victim, other than getting them to load the infected web page

## NSA says it would need to scale down spying program ahead of expiration

- The possibility the U.S. government may begin losing access to the surveillance authority even before it would officially lapse on Dec. 31 is likely to increase pressure on lawmakers to quickly renew the law.

- The last thing we would want to do is conduct any operation ... if we did not have an active statute in place, Barnes said in response to a question asked by Reuters.

- We would have to work the dates backwards to make sure we didnt cross the line. Asked about the remarks by Barnes, an NSA spokesman said the agency fully expects Congress to reauthorize the program.

- The scenario articulated by Barnes resembles one that occurred two years ago, when portions of a separate law, the Patriot Act, that allowed the NSA to collect bulk domestic phone metadata were expiring.

- A bipartisan group of lawmakers in Congress is working on legislation to reform aspects of Section 702, but many Republicans, supported by the White House, want to renew the law without changes and make it permanent.

## Whos Molesting Your Corpse?: Necrophilia and Snuff In The Darknet & Clearnet

- Vault of Sex and the DeadJust when you thought I could delve no more deeply into the darknet I bring you this....RIGHT! Well, since my deep dive into the world of cannibalism, I began to look at the other links out there to other paraphilias on offer in the darknet and once again to the clearnet

- Todays menu consists of Necrophilia and Snuff, which is quite the taboo really and something you would expect to be in the so called Darknet

- In as much as what is indexed currently out there in the darknet there are a total of two sites that really cater to these two particular bents

- The first being the one you see above in the screen shot

- This one requires bitcoin payment just to see the content but you can get a taste by clicking on their samples.Sex  The Dead Sex  The DeadWhat seems to be on offer here is a melange of snuff films and images that are staged mixed with actual gore photos culled from the clearnet and other places I suspect

- Generally, it is all pretty vile and all rather violent which then in tandem with the data concerning how much money their bitcoin wallet has ($3140.76) one wonders just how many people are buying this service and how many are here just for the day or are return customers

- The nominal fee to gain entry is (0.027 BTC) which is presently ($112.06) per entry fee

- So, lets tally that one up shall we?Lesee, carry the one....Thats thirty users of this site

## Behind the Masq: Yet more DNS, and DHCP, vulnerabilities

- Posted by Fermin J

- Serna, Staff Software Engineer, Matt Linton, Senior Security Engineer and Kevin Stadmeyer, Technical Program ManagerOur team has previously posted about DNS vulnerabilities and exploits

- Lately, weve been busy reviewing the security of another DNS software package: Dnsmasq

- We are writing this to disclose the issues we found and to publicize the patches in an effort to increase their uptake.Dnsmasq provides functionality for serving DNS, DHCP, router advertisements and network boot

- This software is commonly installed in systems as varied as desktop Linux distributions (like Ubuntu), home routers, and IoT devices

- Dnsmasq is widely used both on the open internet and internally in private networks.We discovered seven distinct issues (listed below) over the course of our regular internal security assessments

- Once we determined the severity of these issues, we worked to investigate their impact and exploitability and then produced internal proofs of concept for each of them

- We also worked with the maintainer of Dnsmasq, Simon Kelley, to produce appropriate patches and mitigate the issue.These patches have been upstreamed and are now committed to the projects git repository

## [1710.00551] Another Flip in the Wall of Rowhammer Defenses

-   References  CitationsNASA ADS 

- (Submitted on 2 Oct 2017)  Abstract: The Rowhammer bug allows unauthorized modification of bits in DRAM cells from unprivileged software, enabling powerful privilege-escalation attacks.

- In this paper, we present novel Rowhammer attack and exploitation primitives, showing that even a combination of all defenses is ineffective.

- Memory waylaying exploits system-level optimizations and a side channel to coax the operating system into placing target pages at attacker-chosen physical locations.

- Our Rowhammer enclave can be used for coordinated denial-of-service attacks in the cloud and for privilege escalation on personal computers.

## chromiumos/platform/crosvm - Git at Google

- crosvm - The Chrome OS Virtual Machine MonitorThis component, known as crosvm, runs untrusted operating systems along with virtualized devices.

- By using the -r argument, the kernel is automatically told to use that image as the root, and therefore can only be given once.

- If running rustfmt causes a lot of churn for a file, do not check in lines unrelated to your change.DependenciesWith a few exceptions, external dependencies inside of the Cargo.toml files are not allowed.

- The reason being that community made crates tend to explode the binary size by including dozens of transitive dependencies.

- Because some syscalls vary by architecturs, the seccomp policies are split by architecture.

## Breaking DKIM - on Purpose and by Chance

-  October 2017 For the impatient See  for how to create a mail which looks like it comes from DHL, passes DKIM and DMARC validation, but shows a content which is fully controlled by the attacker.

- Moreover if we look at the source of the mail Gmail provides a nice summary which includes the attacker set Date and Message-Id and also shows the DKIM passes successfully.

- The MIME standard defines the Content-Transfer-Encoding's base64 and quoted-printable which allow longs lines, non-ASCII characters and also binary data to be presented within the restrictions of the original mail delivery.

- In fact the DKIM standard itself mentions in section 5.3 this problem and shows how to deal with it:  Some messages, particularly those using 8-bit characters, are subject to modification during transit, notably conversion to 7-bit form.

- But also providers of security services around mail like Mimecast or Spamfence are affected, which might use an invalid DKIM signature as an indicator of detected spoofing and classify the message accordingly.

## Abusing GDI for Ring0 Exploit Primitives: Evolution | Bluefrostsecurity

-                         AbstractEvolution in Windows exploitation techniques led to enormous efforts by vendors to protect their software with exploit mitigations including among other things, sandbox implementations in Chrome, Edge, Firefox, and the latest versions of Microsoft Office

- At the same time, Microsoft increased efforts to protect the Windows kernel, especially in Windows 10, implementing a considerable amount of new exploit mitigations with each update (particularly in Anniversary and Creators Update.) As part of the infamous incident involving Hacking Team in 2015, kernel exploits were leaked which used techniques to abuse GDI objects

- These techniques were described and presented in 2015 at the Ekoparty security conference in the first talk of the series, Abusing GDI for ring0 exploit primitives

- In the Windows 10 Anniversary Update (v1607), this technique was partly mitigated

- A year later, at Ekoparty 2016, the second version of this talk was presented under the name Abusing GDI for ring0 exploit primitives: Reloaded, in which a new technique was introduced, to continue abusing GDI objects

- Microsoft once again mitigated part of this technique in the new Windows 10 Creators Update (v1703) that was rolled out in April 2017. Despite Microsoft's effort to mitigate this vector, the latest techniques based on GDI objects still remain as effective as the original ones in previous versions of Windows

- In this third presentation, we will explain how to use one of these techniques for reliable kernel exploitation on Windows 10 (v1703)

- Based on the most current Insiders Preview (RS3-RedStone3), we will take a look at Microsoft's mitigation plan for its future update (Fall Creators Update) and demonstrate a way to bypass it

## Over The Air - Vol. 2, Pt. 2: Exploiting The Wi-Fi Stack on Apple Devices

- Posted by Gal Beniamini, Project ZeroIn this blog post well continue our journey towards over-the-air exploitation of the iPhone, by means of Wi-Fi communication alone

- This part of the research will focus on the firmware running on Broadcoms Wi-Fi SoC present on the iPhone 7.Well begin by performing a deep dive into the firmware itself; discovering new attack surfaces along the way

- After auditing these attack surfaces, well uncover several vulnerabilities

- Finally, well develop a fully functional exploit against one of the aforementioned vulnerabilities, thereby gaining code execution on the iPhone 7s Wi-Fi chip

- In addition to gaining code execution, well also develop a covert backdoor, allowing us to remotely control the chip over-the-air.Along the way, well come across several new security mechanisms developed by Broadcom

- While these mechanisms carry the potential to make exploitation harder, they remained rather ineffective in this particular case

- By exploring the mechanisms themselves, we were able to discover methods to bypass their intended protections

- Nonetheless, we remain hopeful that the issues highlighted in this blog post will help inspire stronger mitigations in the future.All the vulnerabilities presented in this blog post (#1, #2, #3, #4, #5) were reported to Broadcom and subsequently fixed

## Anonymous Crypto Spectrecoin Now With Tor-obfs4 Integration

-                      Share10 Share4Shares 14Spectrecoin was launched on November 20th of 2016, the first actively developed cryptocurrency with the whole network running entirely on the TOR network, hiding the participants IP addresses

- Spectrecoin has recently released V1.33 and now includes what is known as a TOR obfuscation protocol called OBFS4 fully integrated and automated.This makes Spectrecoin the only cryptocurrency offering direct blockchain access in countries censoring the TOR network

- In short, the integration of OBFS4 effectively wraps the TOR traffic in another layer making it appear as normal internet traffic

- When the wallet starts, it will attempt to connect over the TOR network and if that is unsuccessful, the wallet will automatically invoke the OBFS4 protocol to hide the TOR traffic

- The Spectrecoin team has made a successful test of this system to penetrate the great firewall of China.This development, unique to Spectrecoin, is of increasing importance as more governments attempt to restrict and censor the internet and the private flow of cryptocurrency and information within it

- TOR blocked countries include China, Russia, Iran, Saudi Arabia  Bahrain, with more on the way

- Utilizing the TOR network and obfuscating it with OBFS4, Spectrecoin has quietly leapt to the head of the pack, offering blockchain access in all of those countries.Since their infamously lackluster ICO in 2016, during a period when all ICOs were viewed with deep caution, a small community of enthusiasts from all walks of life have gathered around this coin to help it achieve its goals

- Having exhausted their limited resources in recent months, the original ICO investors got together and collected the funds to keep development moving full-time

## Feds Claim Proceeds from Seized Silk Road Fortune at Only $334 per Bitcoin

- The US Justice Department was finally able to claim the proceeds from the sale of 144,336 Bitcoins sized when they shut down illicit online market, the Silk Road, in 2013.Ross Ulbricht, also known as the Dread Pirate Roberts, and the man behind the Silk Road, recently gave up his claim to these seized coins as he remains behind bars.The amount collected by the Feds was around $48 mln for the 144,336 coins, far below their worth at todays prices as it seems even the Justice Department fell folly to the old adage of selling low.Selling lowThe seized Bitcoins were sold off in a series of auctions back in 2014 and 2015, and the accumulation of $48 mln indicates that they averaged to price of the coins at $334.In retrospect, the sale appears to be a matter of bad timing for the government: the price of a Bitcoin was as high as $1,000 at the end of 2013 before the digital currency went into a prolonged slump until mid-2016 when it began to soar.The current price is around $4,400 - meaning the Justice Department would have made around $630 mln had the sale taken place today.Dropping the claimIt was only last week that Ulbricht decided to formally drop the claims he had to the Bitcoin that was sized

- According to the office of Joon H

- Kim, the Acting US Attorney for Manhattan, it means the government now has rights to the proceeds.The reason for Ulbricht challenging the seizure came in part because of the corrupt secret service agents that were exposed in the investigation.Two agents were implicated in corruption, one from the Drug Enforcement Agency and the other from the Secret Service, who posed as criminals in order to steal Bitcoins.Despite the actions of the corrupt officials, there was still more than enough evidence to sink Ulbricht including detailed server and chat records that identified him as the "Dread Pirate Roberts" who built and controlled Silk Road.

I also have access to team repositories made by my friends, family, and coworkers: founding docs for Keybase; some nostalgia from the old OkCupid and SparkNotes days; maybe even some shared . This is working today and you, too, can use it. Actually private It is end-to-end encrypted.

- We provide a remote helper, powered by the excellent go-git project, which we've begun contributing to. We bring to the table: (1) crypto, (2) team + multi-device key management, (3) a safer concept of identity.

- Unlike casual PGP signing of commits, which no one in the world ever does, this is fully enforced for yourself or team. You don't need to think about it: if you do a git pull, you'll only get the data if it's bit-for-bit exactly what the pusher pushed.

## Mind-Boggling Math Could Make Blockchain Work for Wall Street

-             A major breakthrough in cryptography may have solved one of the biggest obstacles to using blockchain technology on Wall Street: keeping transaction data private.Known as a zero-knowledge proof, the new code will be included in an Oct

- 17 upgrade to the ethereum blockchain, adding a level of encryption that lets trades remain private

- Previously, users were able to remain anonymous but transactions were verified by allowing everyone on the network to see them.Zero-knowledge proofs are one of the biggest inventions in the last two decades in cryptography, said Emin Gun Sirer, an associate professor of computer science at Cornell University

- It will allow a slew of applications we cant even imagine right now.                Read more: Wall Street debates whether to get involved in cryptocurrenciesAn industry group called the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance -- whose members include JPMorgan Chase  Co., Credit Suisse Group AG and BP Plc -- is trying to leverage zero-knowledge proofs for the financial industry with its distributed ledger, known as Quorum.This could be the moment Wall Streets blockchain champions have been waiting for

- Its ability to reshape vital financial market functions like clearing and settlement has always hinged on whether banks can keep customer and proprietary data secret

- Zero-knowledge proofs, a theoretical possibility for decades, are now a reality, letting transactions be verified without the need to share any of the underlying data.The privacy issue is the main reason blockchain hasnt reached a bigger enterprise solution, said Zooko Wilcox, the founder of Zcash, the first public blockchain to guarantee financial privacy by using zero-knowledge proofs

- Thats our deal with JPMorgan and Quorum to use zero-knowledge proofs to have private transactions and settlements.Blythe Masters Unveils Fix for Blockchain Privacy Concerns                Many of the largest blockchains in use, such as the ones that support bitcoin and ethereum, are open to the public with user identities shielded by pseudonymous addresses

- Every transaction can be traced
