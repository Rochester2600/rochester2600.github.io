## A Lithuanian Phisher Tricked Two Big US Tech Companies Into Wiring Him $100 Million

- Rimasauskas even went so far as to create fake contracts on forged company letterhead, fake bank invoices, and various other official-looking documents to convince employees of the two companies to send him money

- , a 48-year-old Lithuanian scammer named Evaldas Rimasauskas managed to trick two American technology companies into wiring him $100 million.

- by masquerading as a prominent Asian hardware manufacturer,"

- What makes this remarkable is not Rimasauskas' particular phishing scam, which sounds rather standard in the grand scheme of wire fraud and cybersecurity exploits. Rather, it's the amount of money he managed to score and the industry from which he stole it

## Burglars Can Easily Make Google Nest Security Cameras Stop Recording

- The third flaw is a bit more serious, as it allows the attacker to force the camera to temporarily disconnect from the wireless network to which it is connected by supplying it a new SSID to connect to. If that particular SSID does not exist, the camera drops its attempt to associate with it and return to the original Wi-Fi network, but the whole process can last from 60 to 90 seconds, during which the camera won't be recording

- Triggering one of these flaws will make the devices crash and reboot

- Google Nest's Dropcam, Dropcam Pro, Nest Cam Outdoor and Nest Cam Indoor security cameras can be easily disabled by an attacker that's in their Bluetooth range

- The vulnerabilities are present in the latest firmware version running on the devices (v5.2.1)

- The first two flaws can be triggered and lead to a buffer overflow condition if the attacker sends to the camera a too-long Wi-Fi SSID parameter or a long encrypted password parameter

## Ebay Asks Users To Downgrade Security

- a form of authentication that security experts say is less secure than other forms of two-factor authentication (2FA). The move by Ebay comes just months after the National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) released a draft of new authentication guidelines that appear to be phasing out the use of SMS-based two-factor authentication.

- Ebay has started to inform customers who use a hardware key fob when logging into the site to switch to receiving a one-time code sent via text message.

## W3C Erects DRM As Web Standard

- a decision over whether to officially adopt EME will depend on a poll of its members. That survey was sent out yesterday

- this anti-piracy mechanism was crafted by engineers from Google, Microsoft, and Netflix, and has been in development for some time,"

- will have until April 19 to register their opinions.

- If EME gets the consortium's rubber stamp of approval, it will lock down the standard for web browsers and video streamers to implement and roll out.

## The State of Internet Censorship in Thailand

- The ISOC would be authorised to exercise its powers with respect to situations affecting the national security where a state of emergency has not been declared yet, bypassing the role of parliaments and courts in reviewing or approving the necessity of such abuses of power.

- However, authorities have the right to reject requests for the disclosure of information under Article 15 of the act, under unclear and overly broad reasons such as the decline in efficiency of law enforcement, risk to national security, and endangerment of life or safety to any person.

- Its important though to note that a false negative could potentially occur in the hypothetical instance that ISPs are using highly sophisticated censorship and/or surveillance software that is specifically designed to not trigger errors when receiving invalid HTTP request lines like the ones of this test.

- Upon analysis of the collected data, the findings illustrate that ISPs in Thailand are primarily implementing censorship through DNS hijacking and through the use of middle boxes (HTTP transparent proxies) which serve block pages.

- To this end, OONI software tests were run across 16 different local vantage points in Thailand with the aim of collecting and analyzing network measurement data that could help examine whether sites, instant messaging apps, and censorship circumvention tools were blocked.

## Satellite Navigation 'Switches Off' Parts of Brain Used For Navigation, Study Finds

- 89950487story Satellite Navigation 'Switches Off' Parts of Brain Used For Navigation, Study Finds  (scientificamerican.com)   A new study published today in the journal Nature Communications reveals some of the drawbacks of using satellite navigation (SatNav) technology

- After scanning the brains of 24 volunteers as they explored a simulation through the streets of London's Soho district, researchers from the University of London found that listening to a satellite navigation's instructions "switches off" activity in parts of the brain used for navigation

- Scientific American reports:  The researchers found that a brain structure called the hippocampus, which is involved in both memory and spatial navigation, appears to encode two different maps of the environment: One tracks the distance to the final destination as the crow flies and is encoded by the frontal region of the hippocampus, the other tracks the "true path" to the goal and is encoded by its rear region

- During the navigation tasks, the hippocampus acts like a flexible guidance system, flipping between these two maps according to changing demands

- Activity in the hippocampal rear region acts like a homing signal, increasing as the goal gets closer

- Analysis of the brain-scanning data revealed activity in the rear right of the hippocampus increased whenever the participants entered a new street while navigating

- It also varied with the number of new path options available

- The more alternatives there were, the greater the brain activity

## Microsoft's Edge Was Most Hacked Browser At Pwn2Own 2017, While Chrome Remained Unhackable

- Tom's Hardware reports:  On the first day, Team Ether (Tencent Security) was the first to hack Edge through an arbitrary write in the Chakra JavaScript engine.

- On the second day, the Edge browser was attacked fast and furious by multiple teams.

- The team leveraged a heap overflow bug in Edge, a type confusion in the Windows kernel, and an uninitialized buffer in VMware Workstation for a complete virtual machine escape.

- The team hacked its way in via the Edge browser, through the guest Windows OS, through the VM, all the way to the host operating system.

-  At last year's Pwn2Own 2016, Edge proved to be more secure than Internet Explorer and Safari, but it still ended up getting hacked twice.

## AMD Confirms It's Issuing a Fix To Stop New Ryzen Processors From Crashing Desktops

- AMD says the company has been able to figure out why FMA3 code is causing system hangs on PCs using a new Ryzen desktop processor

- , the company said that BIOS changes will be distributed to motherboard manufacturers to resolve the issue.

- , all three reportedly cause a hard system lock when running certain FMA3 workloads. The problem was replicated across all three processors and a variety of motherboards.

## Tor upgrades to make anonymous publishing safer

- secret keys for the Advanced Encryption Standard cryptosystem will be twice as long as before

- Older onion services had names made up of 16 random characters. The new ones will use 56 characters, making their domain names look like this: l5satjgud6gucryazcyvyvhuxhr74u6ygigiuyixe3a6ysis67ororad.onion.

- But what if an adversary still manages to find out about it? The Tor Project has solved that problem by allowing onion services to challenge would-be users to enter a password before using it.

- lengthening their names shouldnt affect things much. Because onion domain names have always been hard to remember

- The Tor Project is replacing it with what is called elliptic-curve cryptography, which uses keys that are shorter, more efficient and understood to be at least as secure.

- SHA-1 to the modern SHA-3

- Most of this research paper focused on the USB socket, but it was also revealed that the Nexus 4 has a TTL UART interface hidden in its headphone port as well

- This is interesting because it showed a Galaxy Nexus that ran CyanogenMod allowed access to FIQ Debugger as well as an unprivileged shell.Not too severe there, but when tested on a Galaxy S3 that was running CyanogenMod, they were also able to get access to a root shell

- Again, Michael Ossmann  Kyle Osborn tested the Nexus 4s audio connector and were able to access the TTL UART interface when the voltage on the microphone pin exceeds some threshold

- Since then, these types of tests have been done on other smartphones and weve been seeing Nexus (and even Pixel) phones have some sort of functionality hidden within the headphone port.On the Pixel, Nexus 5, Nexus 5X, Nexus 6 and the Nexus 6P, using this special cable would give you access to the devices BL and platform kernel logs

- This was not possible on the Pixel C, but was discovered to work on the Nexus 9 (CVE-2017-0510)

- Interestingly enough, when doing this on the Nexus 9, the researchers were also able to access the FIQ Debugger as well as HBOOT, though indirectly

- There were some restrictions to the FIQ Debugger, such as not having access to a shell on production builds, and the rare possibility of plugging in malicious headphones while in HBOOT.Still, this is a critical attack vector, and the vulnerability was disclosed to Google, who were able to patch it in the companys March security update.Source: Aleph Security Advisory                                                                                                                                                                 Tagshtcnexus 9                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    About Author                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Doug Lynch                        359 posts                        see posts                                         When I am passionate about something, I go all in and thrive on having my finger on the pulse of what is happening in that industry

## Google takes Symantec to the woodshed for mis-issuing 30,000 HTTPS certs

- Effective immediately, Chrome plans to stop recognizing the extended validation status of all certificates issued by Symantec-owned certificate authorities

- In affect, the certificates will be downgraded to less-secure domain-validated certificates.

- Extended validation certificates are supposed to provide enhanced assurances of a site's authenticity by showing the name of the validated domain name holder in the address bar

- Google plans to update Chrome to effectively nullify all currently valid certificates issued by Symantec-owned CAs

- In October 2015, Symantec fired an undisclosed number of employees responsible for issuing test certificates for third-party domains without the permission of the domain holde

- In January, an independent security researcher unearthed evidence that Symantec improperly issued 108 new certificates

## Minister says encryption on messaging services is unacceptable

- LONDON Technology companies must cooperate more with law enforcement agencies and should stop offering a "secret place for terrorists to communicate" using encrypted messages, British interior minister Amber Rudd said on Sunday.

- British-born Khalid Masood sent an encrypted message moments before killing four people last week by ploughing his car into pedestrians and fatally stabbing a policeman

- We need to make sure organizations like WhatsApp, and there are plenty of others like that, don't provide a secret place for terrorists to communicate with each other."

- "We need to make sure that our intelligence services have the ability to get into situations like encrypted WhatsApp."

## Congress Removes FCC Privacy Protections on Your Internet Usage

- Congress Removes FCC Privacy Protections on Your Internet Usage        Think about all of the websites you visit every day

- Now imagine if the likes of Time Warner, ATT, and Verizon collected all of your browsing history and sold it on to the highest bidder

- That's what will probably happen if Congress has its way.This week, lawmakers voted to allow Internet service providers to violate your privacy for their own profit

- Not only have they voted to repeal a rule that protects your privacy, they are also trying to make it illegal for the Federal Communications Commission to enact other rules to protect your privacy online

- That this is not provoking greater outcry illustrates how much we've ceded any willingness to shape our technological future to for-profit companies and are allowing them to do it for us.There are a lot of reasons to be worried about this

- Because your Internet service provider controls your connection to the Internet, it is in a position to see everything you do on the Internet

- Unlike a search engine or social networking platform or news site, you can't easily switch to a competitor

- And there's not a lot of competition in the market, either

- SecureWorks' Counter Threat Unit offers an analysis of the connection between the APT 28 crew and Russia's Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU) as well as a look at the comprehensive toolkits the cyberspies have put together.

- targets ranging from individuals in Russia and former Soviet states, current and former military and government personnel and organisations in the US and Europe, as well as authors and journalists with an interest in Russia.

- If Iron Twilight's 'active measures' operations in 2016 were intended to influence the US presidential elections, then CTU researchers expect similar operations against elections of strategic interest to the Russian government.

## Japan's Bitcoin Law Goes Into Effect Tomorrow

- Japan is set to begin recognizing bitcoin as a legal method of payment starting tomorrow. The country's legislature passed a law, following months of debate, that brought bitcoin exchanges under anti-money laundering/know-your-customer rules, while also categorizing bitcoin as a kind of prepaid payment instrument. It's a debate that began in the wake of the collapse of Mt Gox, the now-defunct bitcoin exchange that shuttered after months of growing complications and, in the end, revelations of insolvency and alleged fraud. According to Japans Financial Services Agency, that law goes into effect on 1st April, putting in place capital requirements for exchanges as well as cybersecurity and operational stipulations.

- In addition, those exchanges will also be required to conduct employee training programs and submit to annual audits. Yet there may be more work to come in this area. For example, Nomura Research Institute's Yasutake Okano indicated in a May 2016 report that other Japanese laws may need to change to account for the tech, including the Banking Act and Financial Instruments and Exchange Act. Reports indicate that other groups in Japan are moving to plug some of those gaps as well. According to a report from Nikkei, the Accounting Standards Board of Japan decided earlier this week to begin developing standards for digital currencies like bitcoin.

- Its work mirrors other efforts being undertaken elsewhere, including Australia, which began pushing for such standards late last year. Image via Shutterstock

## DDR5 memory is on its way, twice as fast as DDR4

- Typical DDR5 DIMMs will have twice the gigabyte capacity of DDR4 DIMMs.Analysts didn't expect DDR5 to be developed; instead, they thought the line for DDR DRAM would end at DDR4.

- Intel next year will ship Optane memory DIMMs, which could replace DDR DRAM.

- Companies like Dell and Hewlett Packard Enterprise are doubling memory capacity in servers at fast rates to handle those applications.JEDEC also announced that development of the specifications for a new form of hybrid memory called NVDIMM-P is underway.

- NVDIMM is a form of persistent memory, which merges nonvolatile flash storage and volatile DRAM into a DIMM slot.

- This sort of memory is targeted at applications like databases, which use a mix of flash and DRAM for processing and caching.

## The names of the congress members who voted to sell your data

-   Republicans in Congress just voted to reverse a landmark FCC privacy rule that opens the door for ISPs to sell customer data

- Lawmakers provided no credible reason for this being in the interest of Americans, except for vague platitudes about consumer choice and free markets, as if consumers at the mercy of their local internet monopoly are craving to have their web history quietly sold to marketers and any other third party willing to pay

- The only people who seem to want this are the people who are going to make lots of money from it

- (Hint: they work for companies like Comcast, Verizon, and ATT.) Incidentally, these people and their companies routinely give lots of money to members of Congress

- So here is a list of the lawmakers who voted to betray you, and how much money they received from the telecom industry in their most recent election cycle

-                         Got a tip for us? Use SecureDrop or Signal to securely send messages and files to The Verge without revealing your identity.Note on the data below: donations include contributions from corporations in the telecom industry and employees of those corporations (individual and non-individual contributions)

- The largest donors tend to be corporations which contributed funds to the candidate and / or the candidates leadership organization (PAC)

- All figures only reflect donations tallied for the candidates most recent election  many have received total sums much larger than the figure reflected over the course of their career in Congress

## Firefox Goes PulseAudio Only, Leaves ALSA Users With No Sound

- Firefox 52 saw release last week and it makes PulseAudio a hard dependency -- meaning ALSA only desktops are no longer supported.

- the switch won't affect most -- but some Linux users and distros do prefer, for various reasons, to use ALSA, which is part of the Linux kernel

## 71 Percent of Android Phones On Major US Carriers Have Out of Date Security Patches

-  71 Percent of Android Phones On Major US Carriers Have Out of Date Security Patches  (betanews.com) 

- Ian Barker, writing for BetaNews: Slow patching of security flaws is leaving many US mobile users at risk of falling victim to data breaches according to the findings of a new report.

- The study from mobile defense specialist Skycure analyzed patch updates among the five leading wireless carriers in the US and finds that 71 percent of mobile devices still run on security patches more than two months old.

- This is despite Google releasing Android patches every month, indeed six percent of devices are running patches that are six or more months old.

- Without the most updated patches, these devices are susceptible to attacks, including rapidly rising network attacks and new malware, also detailed in the report.

## FedEx Will Pay You $5 To Install Flash

- 90018771story FedEx Will Pay You $5 To Install Flash  (theregister.co.uk)   FedEx's Office Print department is offering customers $5 to enable Adobe Flash in their browsers

- Why would they do such a thing you may ask? It's because they want customers to design posters, signs, manuals, banners and promotional agents using their "web-based config-o-tronic widgets," which requires Adobe Flash

- The Register reports:  But the web-based config-o-tronic widgets that let you whip and order those masterpieces requires Adobe Flash, the enemy of anyone interested in security and browser stability

- And by anyone we mean Google, which with Chrome 56 will only load Flash if users say they want to use it, and Microsoft which will stop supporting Flash in its Edge browser when the Windows 10 Creators Update debuts

- Mozilla's Firefox will still run Flash, but not for long

- The impact of all that Flash hate is clearly that people are showing up at FedEx Office Print without the putrid plug-in

- But seeing as they can't use the service without it, FedEx has to make the offer depicted above or visible online here

- That page offers a link to download Flash, which is both a good and a bad idea

- This means that you can tag as many people in your tweet as you'd like, but still have 140 characters for your actual message

- With this change, Twitter is also tweaking how usernames are shown when you're @ replying to people

- Now you'll see "Replying to" followed by user names at the top of your tweet, rather than a long string of user names in the tweet itself

## DNSCrypt  A protocol to improve DNS security

-                   [03/23/2017] New resolver in San Francisco, CA: nxd.ist                    Thanks to Justin Paine for running it!                            DNSCrypt            DNSCrypt is a protocol that authenticates communications between a DNS client and a DNS resolver

- It prevents                DNS spoofing

- It uses cryptographic signatures to verify that responses originate from the chosen DNS resolver                and haven't been tampered with.                        It is an open specification, with free and opensource reference implementations, and it is not affiliated with                any company nor organization.            Free, DNSCrypt-enabled resolvers are available all over the world                            A couple companies, organizations and individuals are operating public recursive DNS servers supporting the DNSCrypt protocol, so that                all you need to run is a client.                                        A constantly updated list of open DNSCrypt resolvers                can be downloaded to replace the default CSV file shipped with the                 client.                                        If you are running your own public DNS resolver in order to help make the Internet a more secure place, please submit a                pull request to have your resolver added to                the list of public DNS resolvers.                                        Installing a DNSCrypt client                            DNSCrypt itself is not a product, but a protocol that anyone can implement

- Portable implementations are also available,                on top on which graphical user interfaces and convenient tools have been built.                                        Choose your platform to discover some of the available options:  -                 -  -                 -  or run the software on a .                                        Firewall setup: although some resolvers may prefer a different port, the default port used by the DNSCrypt protocol is 443.                Outgoing queries to this port on both TCP and UDP should be allowed by your firewall.

## Net Neutrality Is Trumps Next Target, Administration Says

-                                                             The Trump administration served notice on Thursday that its next move to deregulate broadband internet service companies would be to jettison the Obama administrations net neutrality rules, which were intended to safeguard free expression online.The net neutrality rules, approved by the Federal Communications Commission in 2015, aimed to preserve the open internet and ensure that it could not be divided into pay-to-play fast lanes for web and media companies that can afford it and slow lanes for everyone else.Supporters of net neutrality have insisted the rules are necessary to protect equal access to content on the internet

- Opponents said the rules unfairly subjected broadband internet suppliers like Verizon, ATT, Comcast and Charter to utility-style regulation.In a news conference, Sean Spicer, the White House spokesman, mentioned the net neutrality rules affecting telecommunications and cable internet services, noting that the Obama administration had reclassified them as common carriers.Mr

- Spicer said President Trump had pledged to reverse this overreach. The Obama-era rules, Mr

- Spicer said, were an example of bureaucrats in Washington placing restrictions on one kind of company  internet service suppliers  and picking winners and losers.Telecommunications and cable television companies fought being classified as common-carrier utility services, which are subject to anti-blocking and anti-discrimination rules

- They said the classification opened the door to government interference that would ultimately reduce incentives to invest and would therefore result in higher prices and hurt consumers.Mr

- Spicer made his comments after Congress voted this week to complete its overturning of Obama-era internet privacy protections and to allow broadband companies to track and sell their customers online information with greater ease

- The vote was seen as a prelude to further deregulation for broadband companies.Mr

- Spicer remarked on the rollback of privacy rules before he spoke more broadly about regulations on broadband internet services

## Security Researcher Finds 40 Zero-Day Vulnerabilities in Samsung's Tizen OS

- Security Researcher Finds 40 Zero-Day Vulnerabilities in Samsungs Tizen OS"It may be the worst code I have ever seen"Samsung, being a large multinational company, makes a lot of products spread across various spheres of life and marketed to diverse segments in a multitude of countries

- Over here on XDA-Developers, Samsung is famously known for their Android smartphones and tablets, given they are some of the top contenders for their respective product categories.But that is not all that Samsung makes

- Samsung also makes many more interesting electronics, including a few smart ones that run on its own open-source OS, Tizen OS

- Tizen powers Samsung products like smart TVs, smartwatches like the Gear series and even mobile phones like the Samsung Galaxy Z lineup

- Samsung is seeking to expand the Tizen offerings to more products and more markets, as is evident from the expansion of the Galaxy Z smartphones and the Gear smartwatches.All may not be well with Tizen though

- As security researcher Amihai Neiderman of Equus Software mentioned to Motherboard, Samsungs Tizen OS has as many as 40 zero-day vulnerabilities still active and posing threat to the security of the operating system

- These vulnerabilities allow someone to remotely hack millions of newer Samsung smart TVs, smartwatches and mobile phones, both already on the market as well as ones slated for future release as Samsung does not know and has not fixed these vulnerabilities (hence, zero day).As Motherboard quotes the researcher (emphasis ours),Everything you can do wrong there, they do it

- You can see that nobody with any understanding of security looked at this code or wrote it

## What should password managers not do? Leak your passwords? What a great idea, LastPass

- A victim must have the binary component of LastPass installed to be vulnerable to this attack. "This script will proxy unauthenticated window messages to the extension.

- " All that's needed to exploit the vulnerability are two simple lines of JavaScript code, which Ormandy supplied:  win = window.open("https://1min-ui-prod.service.lastpass.com/"); win.postMessage({}, "*");  The password manager developer has experience with Ormandy after he found another flaw in its code last year that could compromise a punter's passwords just by visiting the wrong website. "We greatly appreciate the work of the security community to challenge our product and uncover areas that need improvement," Joe Siegrist, cofounder and VP of LastPass, told The Register. "We have made our LastPass community aware of the report made by Tavis Ormandy and have confirmed that the vulnerabilities have been fixed.

- " It appears LastPass's fix for the Chrome extension issue was to quickly disable 1min-ui-prod.service.lastpass.com  although some say the server is still working for them, so they are still vulnerable.

- Or just dump LostPass and find other manager.  Updated to add on March 22 LastPass has put out an "incident report" that insists its browser extensions have been patched to squash the above reported bugs, and these builds are being pushed to users: check to see if you're running the latest version of LastPass on your computer, and update your extension if the software hasn't automatically fixed itself.

- Note that the add-on maker is waiting for Microsoft and Opera to approve the updates from their browser extension stores, so the new builds may or may not be there right this second for those particular platforms.

## Error prone, insecure, inevitable: Say hello to today's facial recog tech

-                                 Facial recognition technology represents a valuable, and likely inevitable, method of identification for cops and Feds

- Unfortunately, it's largely unregulated, error prone, and insecure.                During a hearing held by the US House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform on Wednesday, Chairman Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah) acknowledged the potential utility of facial recognition technology even as he expressed concern about the way it is being used.                Chaffetz said the technology makes mistakes, with one in seven FBI facial recognition searches incorrectly returning a list of innocent people as matches, despite the presence of the actual matching image in the database

- Chaffetz also expressed doubts about the government's ability to secure such data

- "I don't believe they can keep all this information locked down and secure," he said.                At issue is whether US citizens can avoid being subject to facial recognition scans in public and which laws will govern such systems.                "Is it the right public policy to populate a database with everybody's face in it...or [just those] who have 'earned it'?" mused Chaffetz.                The hearing comes on the heels of a May 2016 Government Accountability Office report, "Facial Recognition Technology," which happens to include a spoiler in its subtitle: "FBI Should Better Ensure Privacy And Accuracy."                The GAO reviewed the FBI's Next Generation Identification-Interstate Photo System (NGI-IPS) and found that the agency failed to publish data on the privacy risks, failed to adequately evaluate the error rate of the technology, and failed to assess the accuracy of systems operated by external partners, such as states and other federal agencies.                Legislators also revisited the findings of a report published last year by Georgetown Law's Center on Privacy and Technology

- According to that report, the faces of 125 million US adults have been stored in criminal facial recognition databases, most of them innocent of any crime.                EFF senior staff attorney Jennifer Lynch during her testimony observed, "An inaccurate system will implicate people for crimes they didn't commit," shifting the burden onto those individuals to prove their innocence

- And those falsely implicated are more likely to be minorities because of their disproportionate representation in facial recognition databases, Lynch said.                Lynch urged the committee to introduce legislation to require a warrant for accessing non-criminal facial recognition databases and for using real-time facial recognition tracking.                Plans for that are already underway

- Earlier in the hearing, Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) said he was working with lawmakers including Ted Lieu (D-Ca.) to developing a legal framework that will limit how facial recognition is used.                In prepared remarks, Alvaro Bedoya, executive director of the Center on Privacy  Technology at Georgetown Law, said law enforcement agencies in Chicago, Dallas, Los Angeles, New York and West Virginia either have brought real-time facial recognition systems, have announced plans to use the technology, or are actively exploring it

- An agency in Seattle has such as system, Bedoya said, but does not use it for real-time identification.                Responding to questions during the hearing, Bedoya added that about a quarter of police body camera vendors are making provisions to implement facial recognition support in their devices.                Bedoya concluded his remarks on an optimistic note

## LastPass is scrambling to fix another serious vulnerability

- For the second time in two weeks developers of the popular LastPass password manager are working to fix a serious vulnerability that could allow malicious websites to steal user passwords or infect computers with malware.Like the LastPass flaws patched last week, the new issue was discovered and reported to LastPass by Tavis Ormandy, a researcher with Google's Project Zero team

- The researcher revealed the vulnerability's existence in a message on Twitter, but didn't publish any technical details about it that could allow attackers to exploit it.According to Ormandy, the flaw affects the latest version of the LastPass browser extension for all major browsers

- He claims to have tested the exploit successfully on Windows and Linux, but believes that it likely works on Mac as well.[ Further reading: How the new age of antivirus software will protect your PC ]If the extension's binary component is also installed, the vulnerability allows attackers to execute malicious code on users' computers when they visit a rogue website

- If the component is not present, the flaw can still be used to extract passwords from users' secure password vaults.To make things worse, it seems the extension's presence in the browser is enough for the flaw to be exploitable

- Ormandy said on Twitter that the attack still works even if the user is logged out.This is supposedly true only for the remote code execution attack, because without a logged-in session the password vault would remain encrypted and not accessible to a website."We are now actively addressing the vulnerability," the LastPass developers said Monday in a blog post. "This attack is unique and highly sophisticated

- We dont want to disclose anything specific about the vulnerability or our fix that could reveal anything to less sophisticated but nefarious parties."LastPass recommends that users launch websites for which they have stored passwords directly from inside their password vaults by using the "launch" feature

- The company also advises users to turn on two-factor authentication for any online services that offer this option and to beware of phishing attacks and potentially malicious links. Ormandy believes that it will take the company a long time to fix this vulnerability because it is "a major architectural problem." The standard vulnerability disclosure deadline enforced by Google Project Zero is 90 days.To comment on this article and other PCWorld content, visit our Facebook page or our Twitter feed

## Confirmed: TSA bans gear bigger than phones from airplane cabins

- People traveling by air to America from an undisclosed list of countries will no longer be allowed to carry devices larger than a mobile phone in carry-on baggage. Those traveling with such devices will be required to store them in checked baggage. The new travel rule was reportedly issued by the US Transportation Security Administration (TSA) in the form of a confidential email, or circular, on Monday and distributed to nine airlines serving 10 foreign airports in eight countries.

- Recipients of the missive are said to have been given 96 hours to comply. Royal Jordanian Airlines on Monday advised passengers via Facebook that "carrying any electronic or electrical device on board in the flight cabins is strictly forbidden," only to later remove the tweet.  After "instructions from concerned US departments," Royal Jordanian Airlines announces a laptop ban (?)

- The gadgets have to be left behind  or stowed in the hold, which isn't ideal. Royal Jordanian Airlines said the new rule will be enforced Tuesday, March 21, 2017, aboard New York, Chicago, Detroit, and Montreal flights.

- A Royal Jordanian Airlines ticket agent, reached by phone, confirmed the ban.

- "We received an email from the TSA," the agent told El Reg. Saudi Arabia's Saudia Airlines has also acknowledged the ban with a notice to passengers that specifically mentions Kindles and iPads. Asked about the new restrictions, a TSA spokesperson referred The Register to the Department of Homeland Security.

## LastPass release fix for DOM manipulation vulnerability

- Without isolated worlds, unprivileged pages could interfere with higher privileged scripts, and make them do whatever they want. In the case of those running the binary version of the extension, which is less than 10% of LastPass users, it could have been manipulated to allow remote code execution (RCE) on the extension.  Isolated worlds and Trusted Pages  A major part of how LastPass works is content scripts.

- In turn, the content script communicates with the rest of the extension to do the heavy lifting: decrypting saved sites, updating the vault, and so on.

- Consequently, there were many locations in our JavaScript where it was possible for externally-supplied, global variables to override a default value. Fixing the issue Immediately after we received the full report, a cross-functional response team investigated and validated the findings.

- Those changes then needed to be applied and tested across all affected extensions. In short: Comprehensively addressing this report required a significant amount of effort and our team worked around the clock to complete the fixes in a short period of time. To fix, we addressed variable handling and added the Proxy object to the outer scope of the content script, acting as a sandbox to prevent externally-supplied window properties from being read within the content script.

- This is the safest way to access your credentials and sites until this vulnerability is resolved. Two-Factor Authentication on any service that offers it  Whenever possible, turn on two-factor authentication with your accounts; many websites now offer this option for added security. Beware of Phishing Attacks  Always be vigilant to avoid phishing attempts. Do not click on links from people you dont know, or that seem out of character from your trusted contacts and companies.

## Bitcoin Rebounds As Price Tops $1,100

-  Bitcoin prices have surged today, rising over 3% overall since the start of trading and at one stage topping $1,141. At the time of reporting, the price of a bitcoin had fallen slightly to around $1,134, according to the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index, though the general trend seems to be still rising. The sudden increase comes after a fall in prices following the rejection by the SEC of the Winklevoss brothers' bitcoin ETF last month. Bitcoin had been trading at record highs last month in expectation of the announcement, at one stage closing on $1,300 per coin, and surpassing even the per-spot price for an ounce of gold  truly justifying bitcoin's moniker 'digital gold' for the second time in its history. Further, there has been debate in the industry over the path forward for bitcoin and how best to scale the technology going forward.

- That discussion has led to talk of a 'hard fork' of the core software  a possibility that could split the digital currency into two rival coins. Fears over the issue seemed to have hit prices late last month, as bitcoin once again exchanged hands at sub-$1,000 prices mid-to-late March. While it's never easy to directly link events in the real world to movements on the price charts, it would seem that bitcoin traders are shrugging off concerns over the scaling issue and still seeing the core value in the cryptocurrency.

## Android Forums resets passwords after hack

-                                 Add Android Forums to the growing list of web properties that have suffered a security breach.                One in 40 members of the forum (2.5 per cent) were exposed by the hack

- Moderators said they've been able to identify potential compromised accounts, the passwords of which have been reset

- Many of the affected accounts were older and half of them had never posted to Android Forums.                Information taken includes email addresses, hashed passwords, and salt

## Inside OpenSSL's battle to change its license: Coders' rights, tech giants, patents and more

- Analysis The OpenSSL project, possibly the most widely used open-source cryptographic software, has a license to kill  specifically its own.

- But its effort to obtain permission to rewrite contributors' rights runs the risk of alienating the community that sustains it. The software is licensed under the OpenSSL License, which includes its own terms and those dating back to the preceding SSLeay license. Those driving the project announced plans to shift to a new license in 2015 and now the thousand or so people who have contributed code over the years have started receiving email messages asking them to grant permission to relicense their contributions under the Apache Software License, version 2. Theo De Raadt, founder of OpenBSD, a contributor to OpenSSL, and creator of a LibreSSL  forked from OpenSSL in 2014  expressed dissatisfaction with the relicensing campaign in a mailing list post, criticizing OpenSSL for failing to consult its community of authors. "My worry is that the rights of the authors are being trampled upon, and they are only being given one choice of license which appears to be driven by a secret agreement between big corporations, Linux Foundation, lawyers, and such," he explained in an interview with The Register via phone and email. For years, OpenSSL went largely unappreciated, until the Heartbleed vulnerability surfaced in 2014 and shamed the large companies that depend on the software for online security to contribute funds and code. The planned licensing change comes with the endorsement of Intel and Oracle, among the companies that pledged $3.9 million to the Linux Foundation as atonement.

- LibreSSL, boringSSL, and Ring will never agree to go along, he insisted. "That means the trees will fork and it becomes harder to observe the license terms and more software needs to be rewritten," he said, "That's a load of work on the developers who are just trying to make software better.

- That means their contributions will have to be rewritten. As for the other 870 email solicitations sent out, about half have bounced, showing that the open source community has its own version of the orphan works problem. Eric A.

- Young, one of the original creators of the software (along with Tim J. Hudson) and the "eay" in the license name SSLeay, is unable to change his license as a result of contractual terms arising from his decision to join RSA. One of the issues De Raadt has with the way the licensing change campaign is being handled is that OpenSSL's message to contributors states, "If we do not hear from you, we will assume that you have no objection."

## Kite co-pilot preview

- I'm very excited to share with you, on my new blog, a preview for Kite, the programming co-pilot powered by deep learning! According to Kite, this is a desktop application that runs alongside your editor as an artificial pair programmer

- As you type, Kite pulls online documentation, docstrings and other resources to present you things like call arguments and even usage examples! I can glance at Kite when don't want to tab out to the web and search something like the Django documentation

- Despite being some of the best written documentation, finding and scrolling thought it can sometimes take a while, even if you use Find.After using Kite for a few weeks I've noticed it spend less time searching for documentation because it's almost always right there in Kite, or in your editor if you use Sublime

- Being able to read the documentation quickly without tabbing out and wasting time searching and scrolling really makes a difference over time

- I'm really impressed with Kite's ability to search to parse the docstrings of your own project to provide similar suggestions

- I personally prefer this to the Anaconda or other similar IDE plugins for Sublime because of the speed at which the information appears

- Anaconda slows me down and introduces lag into my Sublime, this setup works well for me because I spend less time sifting through documentation and hangups when the completion is rendering

- I also found the Kite completions in Sublime work much better and faster than Anaconda and the built-in completions

## Judge issues search warrant for anyone who Googled a victim's name

- Updated A judge in Minnesota, America, has granted cops a search warrant to direct Google to provide personal details about anyone searching for a specific name. Tony Webster, who describes himself as a web engineer, public records researcher, and policy nerd, published a portion of the warrant out of concern that administrative subpoenas and search warrants are being used for what amounts to fishing expeditions. Under the Fourth Amendment, searches and seizures must be reasonable and as such are generally limited in their scope, to balance privacy expectations.

- The credit union relied on a faxed copy of the victim's passport to verify the transaction, but the document was faked. The search warrant, filed by Edina Police Detective David Lindman, says that when investigators searched Google Images for the victim's name, they found the photo used to make the fake passport  an image of someone who resembled the victim but was not the same person.

- Olson declined to discuss what he characterized as an active case, but said the warrant was related to a felony that had been reported and that it outlined probable cause. The warrant asks for Google user information related to Google searches of the victim's name.

- The request was filed in "the city or township of Edina, County of Hennepin, State of Minnesota," but its extent is unlimited: anyone who searched for this particular victim using Google falls under the granted warrant. 

- The internet king has an interest in fending off overreaching governments and police to avoid becoming an on-demand data dispensary. "We aren't able to comment on specific cases, but we will always push back when we receive excessively broad requests for data about our users," a Google spokesperson said in an email to The Register. Stephanie Lacambra, EFF criminal defense staff attorney, in an email to The Register, expressed skepticism that the warrant as described will be able to survive Constitutional scrutiny. "As a former public defender for over a decade, I can say that this kind of warrant appears both unusual, in that it was approved in the first place without first establishing as a threshold matter that the suspect perpetrator used Google to obtain the photo used in the fraudulent passport in the first place, and overbroad, in that it calls for a dragnet production of the private information of all querents who searched a particular name within a five week time frame without any further limiting factors," she said.

## The U.S. government is stockpiling lists of zero day software bugs that let it hack into iPhones

- It would mean unilaterally disarming themselves in cyberspace, security expert Robert Graham told VICE News.

- The very idea that the government, charged with protecting its citizens, is hoarding cyberweapons that undermine citizens digital security makes some observers bristle.

- The argument has no logic to it, he says, because if you demand they disclose all vulnerabilities they acquired, then they will just stop acquiring vulnerabilities. The RAND report offers a first real glimpse into the world of zero days, after researchers there gained access to a database of more than 200 zero days owned by a company that sells them to governments and other customers on the so-called gray market. The research reveals that up to 25 percent of zero-day vulnerabilities persist for over a decade, with the average life expectancy of such flaws estimated at 6.9 years  the time from the vulnerability being found to when the vendor discovers it and issues a patch, or when a software upgrade inadvertently fixes the mistake.

- I am trying to bring data and science to the discussion, lead researcher Lillian Ablon told VICE News. By their very nature, zero-day vulnerabilities are a mystery.

- Not all vulnerabilities can be exploited, but when they do work, the ultimate goal is remote code execution, whereby the compromised system runs an attackers code without the users knowledge. Who creates them? Zero-day vulnerabilities are created or discovered by hackers, researchers, the government, and companies that specialize in developing cyberweapons to sell to intelligence agencies and law enforcement. Many companies run public bug bounty programs where they challenge researchers to find flaws in their systems  including zero-day vulnerabilities  paying them a fee for disclosing them.

## Yes, Python is Slow, and I Dont Care

- lines of code is always less in Python

- Optimize for your most expensive resource. Thats YOU, not the computer.

- Choose a language/framework/architecture that helps you develop quickly (such as Python). Do not choose technologies simply because they are fast.

- When you do have performance issues: find your bottleneck

- Your bottleneck is most likely not CPU or Python itself.

- If Python is your bottleneck (youve already optimized algorithms/etc.), then move the hot-spot to Cython/C

- Go back to enjoying getting things done quickly

-  Is the version of the dependency I propose to include currently free from vulnerabilities? (Including any vulnerabilities in the transitive closure of dependencies).

-  Do I have an active process in place to alert me when a new vulnerability is found in the dependency

-  Do I know where new versions of the dependency will be announced?

- Do I have an active process in place to alert me when a new version is released? (The release notes may contain information about important fixes that didnt get flagged as a vulnerability for some reason).

- the worst offending community images contained almost 1,800 vulnerabilities

- Official images were much better, but still contained 392 vulnerabilities in the worst case

## Google's Project Zero researcher discovers major security issue in LastPass

- The popular service designed to help internet users protect their online accounts and, as such, is an obvious target for cybercriminals.

- LastPass hasnt revealed any further details about the problem, but Googles Project Zero security researcher Tavis Ormandy, who discovered it, says its a serious one.

- Mr Ormandy wont provide further details about how the bug can be exploited until 90 days have passed since the company was first notified, as is Project Zeros policy.

- We dont want to disclose anything specific about the vulnerability or our fix that could reveal anything to less sophisticated but nefarious parties, wrote LastPass in a blog post.

- In the meantime, LastPass recommends users enable two-factor authentication on any sites that offer the technique and beware of phishing attempts, taking care to avoid clicking on suspicious links.

## Gnirehtet  Reverse-tethering tool for Android

- developing a tool providing reverse tethering for Android, so that devices may use the internet connection of the computer they are plugged in, without requiring any root access (neither on the device nor on the computer). It works on GNU/Linux, Windows and Mac OS.

- How to use gnirehtet

- Basically, just download the latest release, extract it, and execute the following command on the computer:

./gnirehtet rt

- The client registers itself as a VPN, in order to intercept the whole device network traffic, as byte[]  of raw IPv4 packets, which it transmits to the relay server over a TCP connection (established over adb).

- The relay server parses the packets headers, open connections from the computer to the requested destinations, and relays the content in both directions following the UDP and TCP protocols

## Smart TV hack embeds attack code into broadcast signalno access required

- A new attack that uses terrestrial radio signals to hack a wide range of Smart TVs raises an unsettling prospectthe ability of hackers to take complete control of a large number of sets at once without having physical access to any of them.

- The proof-of-concept exploit uses a low-cost transmitter to embed malicious commands into a rogue TV signal. That signal is then broadcast to nearby devices.

- By exploiting two known security flaws in the Web browsers running in the background, the attack was able to gain highly privileged root access to the TVs

- Weeping Angel is described in a cache of CIA documents recently published by WikiLeaks

## Cerebrum: Mobile Passwords Lifted Acoustically with NASB

- there is a new long-distance hack on the scene

- The Cerebrum system represents a recent innovation in side-channel password attacks leveraging acoustic signatures of mobile and other electronic devices to extract password data at stand-off distances.

- It uses Password Frequency Sensing (PFS), where the acoustic signature of a password being entered into an electronic device is acquired, sent up to the cloud, passed through a proprietary deep learning algorithm, and decoded

- The prototype was tested by interfacing a magnetic loop antenna directly onto the Cerebrum through a coax-to-marshmallow transition

- By walking the street with a low-profile loop antenna, numerous passwords were successfully detected and decoded.

- To maximize range, additional antenna aperture were added and mounted onto a mobile platform including a log periodic, an X-band parabolic dish, and a magnetic loop antenna to capture any and all low frequency data

## Anarchist bitcoin hacker flies to Syria to join a 4-million person anarchist collective the size of Massachusetts

- Amir Taaki is a well-known anarchist bitcoin hacker whose project, Dark Wallet, is meant to create strong anonymity for cryptocurrency transactions

- when he discovered that anarchists around the world had gone to Rojava, a district in Kurdish Syria on the Turkish border, to found an anarchist collective with 4,000,000 members

- based on principles of local direct democracy, collectivist anarchy

- he left his home in the UK to defend it

- Taaki spent months fighting at the front, watching his friends die to jihadi machine-gun ambushes, before someone figured out that he had special skills relevant to the cause

- He was finally transfered to Qamishli, Rojava's capital, where he worked as a technologist before deciding to return to Britain to finish Dark Wallet in the hopes that strongly anonymous cryptocurrency could be a fundraising tool for anarchist free states.

- However, he was arrested and accused of terrorism as soon as he landed

## Using Intel's SGX to Attack Itself

- Researchers have demonstrated using Intel's Software Guard Extensions to hide malware and steal cryptographic keys from inside SGX's protected enclave:

- in a cloud scenario it is crucial that the hypervisor isolates tenants from other tenants that are co-located on the same physical machine

- However, the hypervisor does not protect tenants against the cloud provider and thus the supplied operating system and hardware

- In this paper, we demonstrate fine-grained software-based side-channel attacks from a malicious SGX enclave targeting co-located enclaves

- Our attack is the first malware running on real SGX hardware, abusing SGX protection features to conceal itself

## APT29 Used Domain Fronting, Tor to Execute Backdoor

- APT29, a/k/a Cozy Bear, has been utilizing a technique called domain fronting in order to secure backdoor access to targets for nearly two years running, experts said Monday.

- The nation state attackers have reportedly been pairing the anonymity software Tor with a Tor plugin that specializes in domain fronting in order to make it seem as if their traffic was going to a legitimate website, such as Google.

- APT29 attackers set up a Tor hidden service to enable a backdoor. The encrypted network tunnel allows for the forwarding of traffic from the client to local ports 139  NetBIOS, 445  Server Message Block, and 3389  Terminal Services.

- Google disabled the reflection server being used, meek-reflect.appspot.com, Mandiant said, but acknowledges that other servers, from Googles cloud infrastructure, and from supported CDNs, can do the same thing.

## DNS lookups can reveal every web page you visit, says German boffin

- Domain-name lookups only reveal websites visited, not individual pages viewed, right? Wrong

- the interaction between a user and the DNS is more revealing than previously believed, according to a paper from German postdoc researcher Dominik Herrmann.

- behavioural tracking using recursive name servers is a genuine privacy risk.

- Visits from one IP to Google followed by favourite newspapers, shopping sites, government services or transport are enough to identify a user when they pop up under a different IP, Herrmann reckons, and this behavioural chaining doesn't have to rely on tracking cookies.

Chukwuemeka Okparaeke is accused of dealing in very nasty stuff: Fentanyl, a high-strength synthetic opioid the Centre for Disease Control says is 50 times the potency of heroin and was responsible for nearly 10,000 deaths in the US in 2015. Okparaeke may have been a capable Tor user, but his logistical clue needed work: he was caught not because someone linked him to his handle (Fentmaster, on a site called the AlphaBay Marketplace), but because wearing latex gloves while depositing large numbers of packages at US post offices got the attention of staff. He was seen at several post offices in the Middletown area of New York, and because he was bulk-buying priority delivery stamps, staff had also viewed his driver's licence. The United States Department of Justice's (DoJ's) filing sets out where things went from there.

- Law enforcement was already interested in the area as a source of fentanyl analogs, so the approach from a postal inspector was welcome. Investigators only needed to place an order with Fentmaster and keep an eye on Okparaeke to tie him to the fentanyl he sent them. When arrested, Okparaeke's Galaxy S5 carried the tools you'd expect: the Private Internet Access VPN application, the Orbot Tor proxy, and a Bitcoin app. There were also text messages suggesting Okparaeke realised he was being watched, and tried to recruit someone else to distribute packages on his behalf. In an act of astonishing naivete, Okparaeke didn't clear his browser history, so police were also able to connect him to a lengthy Reddit post under the handle bmoreproduct1, describing his activities as a darknet drug trader. The DoJ media release says Okparaeke is charged with one count of conspiracy to distribute large quantities of an analogue of fentanyl, which if he's found guilty will get him a sentence between ten years and life.

## WikiLeaks Not Disclosing CIA-Hoarded Vulnerabilities to Companies

- WikiLeaks has started publishing a large collection of classified CIA documents, including information on several -- possibly many -- unpublished (i.e., zero-day) vulnerabilities in computing equipment used by Americans.

- This week, Assange sent an email to Apple, Google, Microsoft and all the companies mentioned in the documents.

- But instead of reporting the bugs or exploits found in the leaked CIA documents it has in its possession, WikiLeaks made demands, according to multiple sources familiar with the matter who spoke on condition of anonymity.

- WikiLeaks included a document in the email, requesting the companies to sign off on a series of conditions before being able to receive the actual technical details to deploy patches, according to sources.

- It's unclear what the conditions are, but a source mentioned a 90-day disclosure deadline, which would compel companies to commit to issuing a patch within three months.

## New Paper on Encryption Workarounds

- Our goal was to present a taxonomy of different workarounds, and discuss their technical and legal characteristics and complications.

- Second, the different resources required for different workarounds will have significant distributional effects on law enforcement.

- Some techniques are inexpensive and can be used often by many law enforcement agencies; some are sophisticated or expensive and likely to be used rarely and only by a few.

- And fourth, the law governing encryption workarounds remains uncertain and underdeveloped.

- Whether encryption will be a game-changer or a speed bump depends on both technological change and the resolution of important legal questions that currently remain unanswered.

## Shielding MAC addresses from stalkers is hard and Android fails miserably at it

- Equally alarming, of the six percent of Android phones the researchers saw providing randomization, virtually all of them periodically sent out probes using their unique MAC address, a flaw that largely rendered the measure useless.

- In sharp contrast, virtually all of the iOS devices observed by the researchers provided robust randomization. False sense of security Travis Mayberry, a professor at the US Naval Academy and one of the authors of the paper, wrote in an e-mail: Our research contains two important results for the average user: 1) it turns out that most Android phones simply do not have this technology enabled, despite the fact that they are running new versions of the operating system that should allow for it and 2) there are many weaknesses in the way randomization is implemented that make it easy to circumvent.

- This leaves people with a false sense of security because they think this technology is protecting them from tracking when actually it is not. The biggest problem with phones that have randomization enabled is that with the exception of the Cat S60, they regularly reveal their hardware MAC address even when they're not associated with the access point they're communicating with.

- While it may not always be practical for an attacker to actively stimulate the phone in this manner, it is unfortunate and disconcerting that device activity unrelated to WiFi causes unexpected consequences for user privacy. The researchers said the probes advertising that hardware-connected MAC addresses can be made even when Wi-Fi is turned off, for instance, when Wi-Fi-based location settings are enabled. Even when Android devices aren't showing their global MAC address, the researchers found other ways to identify individual phones.

- Only by combining these signatures are we able to accurately and efficiently retrieve the global MAC address. The researchers said the refined fingerprinting technique defeats randomization in 96 percent of Android phones that have the privacy feature implemented. Other ways to defeat Android randomization included what's known as a Karma attack, in which an attacker access point uses the same SSID as one belonging to a Wi-Fi network that a target phone is set up to automatically connect to.

## If you were cuffed during Trump's inauguration, cops are trying to crack your smartphone

-                                 Vid The inauguration of President Donald Trump in the US capital was marked by protests, with cops collaring more than 200 people on the day

- Now court documents reveal the US government's efforts to crack the arrestees' locked phones and slurp their contents.                The filings [PDF]  submitted to the Washington DC Superior Court  state that about 230 alleged rioters were cuffed on January 20 amid public outcry that caused over $100,000 in damage  and gave Alt-Reich campaigner Richard Spencer a sore jaw.                  Youtube Video                On Wednesday this week, prosecutors said they seized more than 100 locked cellphones, and claim that these will be accessed and searched.                "The government is in the process of extracting information from the rioters' cellphones pursuant to lawfully issued search warrants, and expects to be in a position to produce all of the data from the searched rioter cellphones in the next several weeks," the filing reads.                "All of the rioter cellphones were locked, which requires more time-sensitive efforts to try and obtain the data."                The papers don't say how the police expect to be able to crack that many phones in such a short period of time, but it's to be assumed that many are not the most current models with security mechanisms that thwart data extraction while locked

- Nevertheless, it's an ambitious target.                It may be that arrestees were forced to unlock their phones using fingerprints which, in the eyes of the law, can be required

- Passcodes, however, are considered intellectual property of a kind and are therefore covered by the Fifth Amendment's protection.                Once the phones have had their data slurped, the contents will be put online on the Department of Justice's cloud-based file-sharing platform called USAfx, which it claims is secure

- Defense attorneys can then access the data while preparing for their clients' court cases.                The US government is also planning [PDF] to conduct the trials en masse to save time

- It has split the accused into four groups, ranging in size from a dozen to 138 defendants

- Defense teams are complaining that this would deny individuals the trials they deserve.                We'll have to wait until the trials start before we get an inkling of the methods used to break that many phones, if indeed the tools will be disclosed

- As we've seen in the FBI's case, sometimes law enforcement is willing to abandon a trial rather than reveal its methods

## Amazing new WikiLeaks CIA bombshell: Agents can install software on Apple Macs, iPhones right in front of them

-                                 Startling leaked documents show the CIA could purchase Apple Macs and iPhones, install spyware onto them, and give them to targets.                The secret files, dumped online today, are the latest documents from WikiLeaks' Vault 7 series of classified CIA hacking tools and manuals

- The files, dated 2008 to 2013, describe malware that could be smuggled onto Apple-designed computers and smartphones before they are handed over to specific targets.                The spying toolkit was made up of various components

- One of them is NightSkies, a "beacon" for iPhones that was available shortly after the first generation of Apple's landmark smartphones went on sale

- By periodically pinging a beacon signal to a listening-post system on the internet, the software let agents track an infected handheld.                The CIA wanted to port NightSkies to Apple MacBook Air laptops, calling the resulting software DarkSeaSkies, according to the leaked files

- This port would include the NightSkies beacon emitter as well as a tool called DarkMatter to install the malware in the machine's EFI firmware, plus SeaPea to hide its processes and network and file system activities from sight.                DarkSeaSkies would also feature a backdoor so the computer can be remotely controlled, and the ability to download files and run executables

- If the malware loses contact with its listening post, it should delete itself

- The tool would be installed by agents on a MacBook Air before being shipped to a target.                Crucially, the CIA documents state agents had "the opportunity to gift a MacBook Air to a target that will be implanted with this tool." In other words, operatives were in a position to give an Apple laptop to someone in the field as a present  perhaps a wedding gift or as a bribe  and wanted to bug the computer to keep tabs on that person

- That means the agents wanted to buy the equipment, infect it, and then pass it to the target as a freebie.                This is in contrast to the spin WikiLeaks has put on the manuals

## Ever visited a land now under Islamic State rule? And you want to see America? Hand over that Facebook, Twitter, pal

- US embassies have been told to examine social media accounts of visa applicants who have ever set foot in Islamic-State-controlled areas. The edict was sent out earlier this month by Secretary of State Rex Tillerson in diplomatic cables.

- These memos, leaked to journalists and revealed on Friday, direct officials to identify "populations warranting increased scrutiny" and perform a "mandatory social media check" on anyone who has visited lands that have been under Islamic State rule. Given that social media is apparently rarely reviewed by consular staff, this move will result in significant upheaval for background checkers. Tillerson's instructions are tied to President Trump's most recent executive order that clamps down on immigrants from selected Muslim-majority nations.

- That's the executive order he issued after US judges halted an earlier version. The courts froze the revised order, too, forcing the Secretary of State to revise edicts sent to embassies earlier this month: in his latest cable, dated March 17, he insisted visa applicants disclose their social network accounts so they can be searched for any troublemaking. Rights lawyers say this means people will be scrutinized depending on where they are from, who they worked for, and what they worship, rather than whether or not they actually pose a security risk. "Most [consular] posts already have populations that they look at for fraud and security issues," Jay Gairson, a Seattle-based immigration attorney, told Reuters. "What this language effectively does is give the consular posts permission to step away from the focused factors they have spent years developing and revising, and instead broaden the search to large groups based on gross factors such as nationality and religion.

- " Some have questioned this social media crackdown, considering a would-be terrorist is probably going to hand over a URL to a dummy profile rather than one they've used to rave against America.

- " Last month, senior officials, energized by President Trump's tough stance on immigration, said they wanted the usernames and passwords to accounts  from Facebook and Twitter to online banking  from certain unlucky visa applicants.

## Exploratory Data Analysis for Tor Marketplaces  The Drugs Case

- The world of anonymous marketplaces represents a novel channel for black markets, which offer a wide variety of illegal merchandize

- For most marketplaces on the darknet, the overall incidence of sales is still not comparable with the sales incidence of similar physical markets

- Nevertheless, given the fact that it reflects an essential trade channel, offering opportunities to new as well as old forms of illegal merchandize to customers worldwide, trading on darknet marketplaces should be thoroughly studied via means of conventional crawling and data analysis, to determine new trends in the trading of illegal goods, whether physical or digital, new drugs and alternative ways for importing socially dangerous merchandize e.g

- drugs, weapons....etc.A recently published paper presented a method for crawling, and manipulation of data for analyzing trading of illicit drugs on such marketplaces

- The paper focused the analysis on AlphaBay, East India Company and Nucleus (Nucleus is gone now) and demonstrated how to perform preliminary drug investigation on basis of exploratory data analysis.Currently, there are over 20 anonymous marketplaces that are active on the dark web, which is part of the deep web

- Practically, anonymous marketplaces are usually implemented in the form of hidden web services on the Tor network

- Darknet marketplaces usually operate via a model similar to that of eBay, with three actors; sellers, buyers and marketplace administrators who take a 5-10% percentage off of each trade for providing the online platform, the escrow service and the framework of rules that regulate all activities taking place on the marketplace

- As per the data published by the Global Drug Survey, online marketplaces account for a small cut of the overall illicit drug sales, despite the fact that they are growing at an accelerating rate and yearly sales grew from approximately $15-17 million in 2012 to $150-180 million in 2015.Method used to collect data:Data was collected using a custom spider to crawl the three marketplaces we referred to

## Rash of in-the-wild attacks permanently destroys poorly secured IoT devices

- The motivation for the PDoS attacks remains unclear, in part because BrickerBot.2 attacked a much wider variety of storage devicesincluding those used by serversrather than storage used only by more limited IoT devices. "When I discovered the first BrickerBot, I thought it was a drastic attempt to stop the IoT Botnet DDoS threat," Radware researcher Pascal Geenens told Ars.

- As the image above shows, in addition to corrupting the storage device, BrickerBot.2 wipes all stored files, removes the default Internet gateway, disables TCP timestamps, and limits the maximum number of kernel threads to just one.

- Radware has more details about the attacks here. The common thread linking all the deviceswhether targeted by BrickerBot.1 or BrickerBot.2is that they are so poorly secured that they are easy prey for Mirai and other highly destructive botnets.

- That leaves open the possibility that the rash of PDoS attacks is being carried out by one or more vigilantes who want to take out these devices before they can be conscripted into a powerful DoS army that poses a serious threat to the Internet as we know it.

- IoT users who don't want to change default passwords and close or limit access to telnet and SSH out of concern they'll be used in crippling attacks against others now have a much more self-interested reason for locking down their devicespreventing them from being bricked.

## New WikiLeaks dump: The CIA built Thunderbolt exploit, implants to target Macs

- ) The ability to exploit Apple computers' EFI firmware dates back at least to January of 2009, with a set of tools the CIA's Engineering Development Group called "DarkSeaSkies."

- As implemented, Sonic Screwdriver obviously required what's been referred to as an "evil maid" attacksomeone has to gain access to the targeted device for an extended period of time to perform the installation.

- The same is true of the other tools in cases where there is no password-protected firmware; the attacker would need to be able to boot the computer from a USB device to install it. In a post this afternoon, Hudson said: The functionality of Sonic Screwdriver appears to be at the same level as presented in snare's slidesthe Option ROM code is loaded before firmware passwords are checked, which allows it to bypass this password and boot from an alternate media device with a more extensive exploit, but does not have any flash level persistence.

- Based on the documentation, as far as I can tell it does not carry any payload of its own and its sole purpose is to be able to boot from external media It's possible that later versions of Sonic Screwdriver were capable of a remote attack if they followed the development path taken by Hudson.

- A second version of Thunderstrike that he created could be spread by e-mail attachment or a malicious website, and that iteration used the Thunderbolt bus to infect firmware in Apple peripherals.

## RULEAKS: Russian Media and Disinformation in Ukraine by the DNR-ONLINE

- The following documents found in this dump show Russias machinations at propaganda in Ukraine, well, at least this small slice of it. DOC1 From Translator: This talks about anti-Russian hysteria in the media and about disinformation and fake news that makes Russia look bad.

-  Initial costs are $79,200 for things like computer equipment, recruiting, registering domain names and getting business and media licenses, and website design.

- The idea is is to create a pro-European, anti-Russian website  with the underlying message that the Ukraine will be better off without those annoying eastern provinces, and let Russia have them, so that it can enjoy its wonderful European future without them dragging the country down.

- My other thought is that maybe someone got hold of the GROUNDBAIT raw sample and re-used it by re-packing it and setting it against dnr-online. An interesting notion... I contacted ESET and talked a bit with the guy who did the work and he was.. Well.. Not so helpful.

- In either case this information makes it clear that in Ukraine the Russian propaganda and espionage machines are alive and well and using the net as a force multiplier at the very least. I will continue looking at the growing dumps by RUH8 and let you all know about any malware and goodies that pop up.
