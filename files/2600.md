## Don't panic, but Linux's Systemd can be pwned via an evil DNS query

- Systemd, the Linux world's favorite init monolith, can be potentially crashed or hijacked by malicious DNS servers.

- Patches are available to address the security flaw, and should be installed ASAP if you're affected. Looking up a hostname from a vulnerable Systemd-powered PC, handheld, gizmo or server can be enough to trigger an attack by an evil DNS service: the software's resolved component can be fooled into allocating too little memory for a lookup response, and when a large reply is eventually received, this data overflows the buffer allowing the attacker to overwrite memory.

- This can crash the process or lead to remote code execution, meaning the remote evil DNS service can run malware on your box. "A malicious DNS server can exploit this by responding with a specially crafted TCP payload to trick systemd-resolved in to allocating a buffer that's too small, and subsequently write arbitrary data beyond the end of it," explained Chris Coulson, of Ubuntu maker Canonical, who discovered the out-of-bounds write in systemd-resolved. The programming blunder, assigned the ID CVE-2017-9445, was accidentally introduced in Systemd version 223 in June 2015 and is present all the way up to and including version 233 in March this year. This means it is present in Ubuntu versions 17.04 and 16.10.

- If there are, well, you know what to do. Meanwhile, researcher Ariel Zelivansky has found some security bugs in Alpine Linux's package manager apk.

- The flaws, assigned CVE-2017-9669 and CVE-2017-9671, allow remote code execution on Alpine Linux instances (including Docker runs), via a buffer overflows in the handling of package files. "The only prerequisite would be to figure out the memory layout of the program," Zelivansky said.

## Security-Focused Purism Librem 13 & 15 Linux Laptops Go Mainstream with Qubes OS

-  Purism, the social purpose corporation focused on designing and manufacturing privacy-conscious hardware and software products, announced the general availability of their security-focused Purism Librem 13 and 15 laptops. Until recently, both Purism Librem 13 and Librem 15 laptops were available only as made-to-order, which means that those who wanted to purchase either model would have to order it first and then wait a few months until the device arrived.

- And now, the company finally managed to scale the production to hold inventory of the laptops. "Since it first launched as a crowdfunding project in 2015, Purism has raised more than $2.5 million through crowdfunding and seed funding, and has been experiencing 38% and 35% average monthly growth over the last 12 months for its Librem 13 and 15 laptops, respectively," reads the press announcement. The laptops ship with PureOS or Qubes OS Powered by Intel Core i5 (for the Librem 13 model) and Intel Core i7 (for the Librem 15 model), both laptops are powered by Purism PureOS, which is a derivative of Debian GNU/Linux.

- However, users can have the laptops shipped with the more advanced Qubes OS security-oriented GNU/Linux operating system. Price starts from $1,699.00 USD for Librem 13 (Intel Core i5 6200U (Skylake) CPU @ 2.80 GHz, Intel HD Graphics 520, 8GB DDR4 2133 MHz RAM, 250GB SSD, and 13.3" 1920x1080p Matte IPS @ 60Hz display, and $1,999.00 USD for Librem 15 (Intel Core i7 6500U (Skylake) @ 3.10 GHz, Intel HD Graphics 520, 8GB DDR4 2133 MHz RAM, 250GB SSD, and 15.6" 1920x1080p Matte IPS @ 60Hz display. The battery of the laptops should last roughly around 7 to 9 hours for the Librem 13 model and 6 to 9 hours for the Librem 15 variant.

- Both models are available for pre-order now and will ship from Purism' inventory beginning June 28, 2017.

- Purism will soon announce a third model, the Librem 11, which will cost about $1,199.00 USD.  Purism Librem 13  Purism Librem 15

## AES-256 crypto cracked in 50 secs using 200 of kit one metre away

-                                 Side-channel attacks that monitor a computer's electromagnetic output to snaffle passwords are nothing new

- They usually require direct access to the target system and a lot of expensive machinery  but no longer.                Researchers at FoxIT have managed to wirelessly extract secret AES-256 encryption keys from a distance of one metre (3.3 feet)  using 200 (~US$224) worth of parts obtained from a standard electronics store  just by measuring electromagnetic radiation

- At that distance sniffing the keys over the air took five minutes, but if an attacker got within 30 centimetres (11.8 inches) of a device, the extraction time is cut down to just 50 seconds.                The research team used a simple loop antenna, attached it to an external amplifier and bandpass filters bought online, and then plugged it into a software defined radio USB stick they bought for 20

- The entire cost of the setup was less than 200 and the device could be hidden in a jacket or laptop case.                They used this kit to record the radio signals generated by the power consumption of the SmartFusion2 target system running an ARM Cortex-M3-powered chip

- By measuring the leakage between the Cortex processor and the AHB bus, the data showed the peaks and troughs of consumption as the encryption process was carried out.                By running a different encryption run on a test rig, the researchers mapped out how the power consumption related to individual bytes of information

- That allowed them to take guesses at the 256 possible values of a single byte and the correct choice showed the highest power spike.                "Using this approach only requires us to spend a few seconds guessing the correct value for each byte in turn (256 options per byte, for 32 bytes  so a total of 8,192 guesses)," they wrote [PDF]

- "In contrast, a direct brute-force attack on AES256 would require 2256 guesses and would not complete before the end of the universe."                The electromagnetic signals drop off rapidly the farther away you are from the target, but the researchers still managed the extraction from a distance of one metre, even though it took much longer to do so

- Spending more on the equipment, however, would increase the range and speed of the attack.                "In practice this setup is well suited to attacking network encryption appliances," they wrote

## Heaps of Windows 10 internal builds, private source code leak online

-                                 Exclusive A massive trove of Microsoft's internal Windows operating system builds and chunks of its core source code have leaked online.                The data  some 32TB of official and non-public installation images and software blueprints that compress down to 8TB  were uploaded to betaarchive.com, the latest load of files provided just earlier this week

- It is believed the confidential data in this dump was exfiltrated from Microsoft's in-house systems around March this year.                The leaked code is Microsoft's Shared Source Kit: according to people who have seen its contents, it includes the source to the base Windows 10 hardware drivers plus Redmond's PnP code, its USB and Wi-Fi stacks, its storage drivers, and ARM-specific OneCore kernel code.                Anyone who has this information can scour it for security vulnerabilities, which could be exploited to hack Windows systems worldwide

- The code runs at the heart of the operating system, at some of its most trusted levels

- It is supposed to be for Microsoft, hardware manufacturers, and select customers' eyes only.                Leaked ..

- Screenshot of a Beta Archives posting announcing on Monday, June 19, the addition of Microsoft's confidential source code archive                In addition to this, top-secret builds of Windows 10 and Windows Server 2016, none of which have been released to the public, have been leaked among copies of officially released versions

- The confidential Windows team-only internal builds were created by Microsoft engineers for bug-hunting and testing purposes, and include private debugging symbols that are usually stripped out for public releases.                This software includes, for example, prerelease Windows 10 "Redstone" builds and unreleased 64-bit ARM flavors of Windows

- There are, we think, too many versions now dumped online for Microsoft to revoke via its Secure Boot mechanism, meaning the tech giant can't use its firmware security mechanisms to prevent people booting the prerelease operating systems.                Also in the leak are multiple versions of Microsoft's Windows 10 Mobile Adaptation Kit, a confidential software toolset to get the operating system running on various portable and mobile devices.                Netizens with access to Beta Archive's private repo of material can, even now, still get hold of the divulged data completely for free

- It is being described by some as a bigger leak than the Windows 2000 source code blab in 2004.                A spokesperson for Microsoft said: "Our review confirms that these files are actually a portion of the source code from the Shared Source Initiative and is used by OEMs and partners."                 Updated to add                Beta Archive's administrators are in the process of removing non-public Microsoft components and builds from its FTP server and its forums.                For example, all mention of the Shared Source Kit has been erased from its June 19 post

## OWASP Mobile Security Testing Guide  GitBook

- Feel free to explore the exiting content, but do note  that it is still incomplete and may change at any time.

- On a beautiful summer day, a group of ~7 young men, a woman, and approximately three squirrels met in a Woburn Forest villa.

- The Mobile Security Testing Guide (MSTG) is an open, agile, crowd-sourced effort, made of the contributions of dozens of authors and reviewers from all over the world. Because this isn't a normal security book, the introduction doesn't list impressive facts and data proving importance of mobile devices in this day and age.

- True excellence at mobile application security requires a deep understanding of mobile operating system, coding, network security, cryptography, and a whole lot of other things, many of which we can only touch on briefly in this book.

- Write your own apps, compile your own kernels, dissect mobile malware, learn how things tick.

## Tor 0.3.0.9 is released (with security update for clients)

- This is a security regression; all clients running earlier versions of 0.3.0.x or 0.3.1.x should upgrade to 0.3.0.9 or 0.3.1.4-alpha when packages become available.

- If you need a release with long-term support, 0.2.9 is what we recommend: we plan to support it until at least 1 Jan 2020. This release also backports several other bugfixes from the 0.3.1.x series. Changes in version 0.3.0.9 - 2017-06-29 Major bugfixes (path selection, security, backport from 0.3.1.4-alpha): When choosing which guard to use for a circuit, avoid the exit's family along with the exit itself.

- Disallowing whitespace prevents differential version parsing between POSIX-based and Windows platforms.

-   Minor bugfixes (linux seccomp2 sandbox, backport from 0.3.1.4-alpha): Permit the fchmod system call, to avoid crashing on startup when starting with the seccomp2 sandbox and an unexpected set of permissions on the data directory or its contents.

- Nevertheless, because the memset()'s purpose is to make sure that any other cell-handling bugs can't expose bytes to the network, we need to fix it.

## In Worrisome Move, Kaspersky Agrees to Turn Over Source Code to US Government

- The company is based in Russia but has worked with both Moscow and the FBI in the past, often serving as a go-between to help the two governments cooperate.

- The Russians alleged involvement in the hacking of the 2016 election combined with numerous suspicious ties to our presidents campaign has everyone on edge.

- Major technology companies like Cisco, IBM, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, McAfee, and SAP have agreed to give the Russian government access to code for security products such as firewalls, anti-virus applications and software containing encryption, according to Reuters.

- In a statement following the WannaCry ransomware attacks, Microsoft said an equivalent scenario with conventional weapons would be the U.S. military having some of its Tomahawk missiles stolen. Its obvious that the US cant be trusted with this knowledge  and companies shouldnt help them gain it.

- In the same way that experts say that you shouldnt pay the ransom when hit by ransomware, tech companies need to block this coercion before it gets out of control.

## Is the business of scientific publishing bad for science?

- The Butterworths directors, being ex-British intelligence themselves, hired the young Maxwell to help manage the company, and another ex-spook, Paul Rosbaud, a metallurgist who spent the war passing Nazi nuclear secrets to the British through the French and Dutch resistance, as scientific editor. They couldnt have begun at a better time.

- After the war, government emerged for the first time as the major patron of scientific endeavour, not just in the military, but through newly created agencies such as the US National Science Foundation, and the rapidly expanding university system. When Butterworths decided to abandon the fledgling project in 1951, Maxwell offered 13,000 (about 420,000 today) for both Butterworths and Springers shares, giving him control of the company.

- Richard Charkin, the former CEO of the British publisher Macmillan, who was an editor at Pergamon in 1974, recalls Maxwell waving Watson and Cricks one-page report on the structure of DNA at an editorial meeting and declaring that the future was in life science and its multitude of tiny questions, each of which could have its own publication.

- That same year, Harvard Library overran its research journal budget by half a million dollars. Scientists occasionally questioned the fairness of this hugely profitable business to which they supplied their work for free, but it was university librarians who first realised the trap in the market Maxwell had created.

- The acquisitive nature that drove Pergamons success also led him to make a surfeit of flashy but questionable investments, including the football teams Oxford United and Derby County FC, television stations around the world, and, in 1984, the UKs Mirror newspaper group, where he began to spend more and more of his time.

## New ransomware, old techniques: Petya adds worm capabilities

- (Note: We have published a follow-up blog entry on this ransomware attack

- We have new findings from our continued investigation, as well as platform mitigation and protection information: Windows 10 platform resilience against the Petya ransomware attack.) On June 27, 2017 reports of a ransomware infection began spreading across Europe

- We saw the first infections in Ukraine, where more than 12,500 machines encountered the threat

- We then observed infections in another 64 countries, including Belgium, Brazil, Germany, Russia, and the United States.The new ransomware has worm capabilities, which allows it to move laterally across infected networks

- Based on our investigation, this new ransomware shares similar codes and is a new variant of Ransom:Win32/Petya

- This new strain of ransomware, however, is more sophisticated.To protect our customers, we released cloud-delivered protection updates and made updates to our signature definition packages shortly after

- These updates were automatically delivered to all Microsoft free antimalware products, including Windows Defender Antivirus and Microsoft Security Essentials

- You can download the latest version of these files manually at the Malware Protection Center.Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection (Windows Defender ATP) automatically detects behaviors used by this new ransomware variant without any updates.Delivery and installationInitial infection appears to involve a software supply-chain threat involving the Ukrainian company M.E.Doc, which develops tax accounting software, MEDoc

## Zero-day Skype flaw causes crashes, remote code execution | ZDNet

-  A critical flaw in Microsoft's Skype web messaging and call service allows attackers to crash systems and execute code.This week, Vulnerability Lab security researcher Benjamin Kunz Mejri revealed the previously unknown vulnerability in a public security disclosure, saying the stack buffer overflow flaw, CVE-2017-9948, impacts Skype versions 7.2, 7.35, and 7.36.Granted a CVSS score of 7.2, the stack buffer overflow flaw is considered dangerous as it permits attackers to remotely crash the application with an unexpected exception error, to overwrite the active process registers, and to execute malicious code.The problem occurs in Skype's use of the MSFTEDIT.DLL file in case of a copy request on local systems.The security team tested the file by copying and pasting a crafted image file from a clipboard into the Skype message box, and when this image was hosted on a clipboard both on a remote and local system, when transmitted, Skype was prompted into a stack buffer overflow, causing errors and a crash which can then be exploited.         

- The vulnerability can be utilized by both local and remote attackers without any interaction on the victim's account, and only a Skype user account with low privileges is a necessary tool for attackers."The limitation of the transmitted size and count for images via print of the remote session clipboard has no secure limitations or restrictions," Vulnerability Lab says.

- ""Thus allows local or remote attackers to execute own codes on the affected and connected computer systems via the Skype software," the team added.

- Vulnerability Lab also provided proof-of-concept (PoC) code within the security disclosure.Vulnerability Lab first notified Microsoft of the bug on 16 May.

- After Microsoft's team acknowledged the problem and developed a fix, a patch was deployed on 8 June, leading to public disclosure on 26 June.The bug has been patched in Skype version 7.37.178, and users should make sure their software is up-to-date to protect themselves from this threat.

## How The Intercept Outed Reality Winner

-  Today, The Intercept released documents on election tampering from an NSA leaker.

- Later, the arrest warrant request for an NSA contractor named "Reality Winner" was published, showing how they tracked her down because she had printed out the documents and sent them to The Intercept.

- The NSA almost certainly has a record of who used the printer at that time.  The situation is similar to how Vice outed the location of John McAfee, by publishing JPEG photographs of him with the EXIF GPS coordinates still hidden in the file.

- Or it's how PDFs are often redacted by adding a black bar on top of image, leaving the underlying contents still in the file for people to read, such as in this NYTime accident with a Snowden document.

- Or how opening a Microsoft Office document, then accidentally saving it, leaves fingerprints identifying you behind, as repeatedly happened with the Wikileaks election leaks.

## Giving perspective on systemd's "usernames that start with digit get root privileges"-bug

- Mattias Geniar, Sunday, July 2, 2017Fire in the hole! There's a new systemd bug that gets the haters aroused! The bug in question is one where systemd's unit files that contain illegal usernames get defaulted to root, so they get run as the root user

- It sounds pretty bad; In case of bug report: Expected behaviour you didn't seeThe process started by systemd should be user previlege In case of bug report: Unexpected behaviour you sawThe process started by systemd was root previlegesystemd can't handle the process previlege that belongs to user name startswith number, such as 0dayLet's break it down.How the bug happensIf you have a systemd unit file that looks like this, the service that should start as the user "0day" will actually be run as the root user.[Unit]Description=0day socat serviceAfter=network.target[Service]User=0dayRestart=alwaysType=simpleWorkingDirectory=/home/0day/ExecStart=/usr/bin/socat TCP-LISTEN:18086,reuseaddr,fork EXEC:"/opt/run-elf"[Install]WantedBy=multi-user.targetThis is definitely a bug, because RHEL7 (and thus, CentOS and other derivatives) do allow usernames that start with a digit

- It's systemd's parsing of the User= parameter that determines the naming doesn't follow a set of conventions, and decides to fall back to its default value, root.Just to prove a point, here's a 0day user on CentOS 7.3.$ cat /etc/redhat-releaseCentOS Linux release 7.3.1611 (Core)$ useradd 0day$ su - 0day$ iduid=1067(0day) gid=1067(0day) groups=1067(0day)That user works

- The bug is thus in systemd where it doesn't recognize that as a valid username.Why the big fuss?If you quickly glance over the bug (and especially the hype-media that loves to blow this up), it can come across as if every username that starts with a digit can automatically get root privileges on any machine that has systemd installed (which, let's be frank, is pretty much every modern Linux distro).That's not the case

- You need a valid systemd Unit file before that could ever happen.This might be a security issue, but is hard to triggerSo in order to trigger this behaviour, someone with root-level privileges needs to edit a Unit file and enter a "invalid username", in this case one that starts with a digit.But you need root level privileges to edit the file in the first place and to reload systemd to make use of that Unit file.So here's the potential security risk;You could trick a sysadmin into creating such a Unit file, hoping they miss this behaviour and trick your user in becoming rootYou need an exploit to grant you write access to systemd's Unit files in order to escalate your privileges furtherAt this point, I don't think I'm missing another attack vector here.Should this be fixed?Yes

- It's an obvious bug (at least on RHEL/CentOS 7), since a valid username does not get accepted by systemd so it triggers unexpected behaviour by launching services as root.However, it isn't as bad as it sounds and does not grant any username with a digit immediate root access.But it's systemd, so everyone loves to jump on that bandwagon and hype this as much as possible

- Here's the deal folks: systemd is software and it has bugs

- The Linux kernel also has bugs, but we don't go around blaming Linus for everyone one of those either.I disabled the comments on this post because I'm not in the mood in yet another systemd debacle where my comment section gets abused for personal threats or violence

## Gagallium : How I found a bug in Intel Skylake processors

- Since MacOS uses Clang and they used a GCC-based Windows port, the finger was being firmly pointed to OCaml 4.03 and GCC. Surely, SIOU reasoned, in the OCaml 4.03 runtime system, there is a piece of bad C code -- an undefined behavior as we say in the business -- causing GCC to generate machine code that crashes, as C compilers are allowed to do in the presence of undefined behaviors.

- That would not be the first time that GCC treats undefined behaviors in the least possibly helpful way, see for instance this security hole and this broken benchmark. The explanation above was plausible but still failed to account for the random nature of crashes.

- The 15 crashes in mark_slice were all caused by a pointer two words ahead in a block of size 4. All those symptoms were consistent with familiar mistakes such as the ocamlopt compiler forgetting to register a memory root with the GC.

- kind; I because I was tired of this problem, didn't know how to report those things (Intel doesn't have a public issue tracker like the rest of us), and suspected it was a problem with the specific machines at SIOU (e.g. a batch of flaky chips that got put in the wrong speed bin by accident). The second sighting The year 2016 went by without anyone else reporting that the sky (or more exactly the Skylake) was falling with OCaml 4.03, so I gladly forgot about this little episode at SIOU (and went on making horrible puns). Then, on January 6th 2017, Enguerrand Decorne and Joris Giovannangeli at Ahrefs (another Serious Industrial OCaml User, member of the Caml Consortium to boot) report mysterious random crashes with OCaml 4.03.0: this is PR#7452 on the Caml bug tracker. In the repro case they provided, it's the ocamlopt.opt compiler itself that sometimes crashes or produces nonsensical output while compiling a large source file.

- On the other hand, there was already one documented hardware issue with hyperthreading and Skylake (link)   Mark Shinwell contacts some colleagues at Intel and manages to push a report through Intel customer support.  Then, nothing happened for 5 months, until... The revelation On May 26th 2017, user "ygrek" posts a link to the following Changelog entry from the Debian "microcode" package: * New upstream microcode datafile 20170511 [...] * Likely fix nightmare-level Skylake erratum SKL150.

## GnuPG crypto library cracked, look for patches

- 

- Linux users need to check out their distributions to see if a nasty bug in libgcrypt20 has been patched. The software fix, which has landed in Debian and Ubuntu, addresses a side-channel attack published last week. The researchers published their work at the International Association for Cryptologic Research's e-print archive last week.

- The paper was authored by Daniel Bernstein, Joachim Breitner, Daniel Genkin, Leon Groot Bruinderink, Nadia Heninger, Tanja Lange, Christine van Vredendaal and Yuval Yarom (who hail variously from the Technical University of Eindhoven, the University of Illinois, the University of Pennsylvania, the University of Maryland, and the University of Adelaide). What they found is that the libgcrypt library used what's called sliding windows, a method for carrying out the mathematics of cryptography  but one that's known to leak data. The researchers looked at the left-to-right sliding window calculation in libgcrypt, in which the sliding window data leak was tolerated because it was believed only part of a key was recoverable (40 percent of bits in a four-bit sliding window; 33 percent in a five-bit sliding window). What they found was an unpleasant surprise: a complete break of the library's RSA-1024: We show for the first time that the direction of the encoding matters: the pattern of squarings and multiplications in left-to-right sliding windows leaks significantly more information about the exponent than right-to-left. To get at the processing, the researchers also needed to carry out a side-channel attack, specifically a flush+reload cache-timing attack that monitors the target's cache access patterns. Debian users can update the library here; Ubuntu has it here.

## ProtonMail lauds Google's EU fine after falling victim to firm's shady search practices | TheINQUIRER

- SWISS-BASED EMAIL AND VPN OUTFIT ProtonMail has welcomed the European Union's decision to fine Google a record-breaking 2.1bn over its practice of downgrading the search results of competitors, saying that it was the victim of these practices last year. In spite of ProtonMail's growing profile and an increased interest in encrypted email in general, the company's position had dropped inexplicably in Google's page rankings throughout most of 2016, making it virtually invisible to people looking for secure email providers.

-  "In doing so, we believe the EU is taking an important step towards protecting consumers and ensuring healthy competition online.

- " Yen continued: "The 2016 incident where ProtonMail was dramatically lowered in Google search results illustrated vividly the dangers of an unregulated monopoly.

- Because of Google's dominant position in search (over 90 per cent market share in Europe), Google holds the power of life and death over large and small businesses. "Any other industry with that level of control, such as the financial sector for example, is subject to extensive regulations, and agree with the EU that search should be no different.

- " Yen added: "We hope that today's landmark ruling will pave the way for further reform, such as providing a formal way to report incidents so that no other company will have to relive the nightmare scenario that ProtonMail encountered. "The EU's ruling today shows that no company, no matter how large or influential, can escape the obligation to play fair online, and ultimately, this is a victory for consumers worldwide."

## NoteHub  Sandboxing X11 for dumm

- Sandboxing X11 for dummies(I don't mean GNOME levels of dumb, you should at least know how to not eat your own faeces)But you can be as dumb as I, which is pretty dumb

- So it's well known that X11 is basically designed like a user account is on Unix

- What does this mean? It means that anything that connects to your X server can essentially introspect and modify the entire X server's contents

- Get this into your head, it can trivially listen to all your keypresses, see all the surfaces of all other windows

- There is no concept of 'privacy' here any more than that any program you run as your user can read and modify all your files

- In theory this is not objectionable, it still can't touch other users so the user-barrier remains protected

- But you can give other users access to your X server at which point those users can read all your keypresses so be mindful when you do that.Now, you often read that X11 is impossible to sandbox against this or whatever, that's a myth

- There are many ways to restrict the access a client can perform, the most common one is a convoluted mess of using a nested X server in which the client is ran that you don't trust

## Terrorist Used Tor to Connect with ISIS, Source Said

-  The background and profiles of the terrorists connected to the London Bridge and Borough Market attack are still full of holes waiting to be filled.

- The reasoning was simple; Khalid Masood, the attacker who reportedly acted alone, sent a message on WhatsApp prior to killing four and wounding dozens.

- And of course, the situation played out similarly to the one between the FBI and Apple in the United States. One of the San Bernardino attackers owned an iPhone that was protected by Apples security mechanisms.

- Apple refused to create a fake firmware update for the phone that removed the devices encryption.  When Masood sent the message on WhatsApp, he unknowingly caused a potential cybersecurity reform.

- The underlying theme involved the radicalization of Youssef Zaghba  the London Bridge attacker with no apparent connections to terrorist propaganda.

## Cisco's 'encrypted traffic fingerprinting' turned into a product

-                                 Cisco has turned research published nearly a year ago into a product it hopes will protect enterprises against malware hidden in encrypted traffic.                As The Register reported in July 2016, a group of Cisco researchers have been working on how to spot dangers entering networks through TLS.                Since you can't see inside encrypted packets (unless you proxy the connection for decryption, a solution troubling both from privacy and security viewpoints), the paper's authors (Blake Anderson, Subharthi Paul and David McGrew) looked for malware signatures in those parts of the traffic that's not encrypted  TLS negotiation packets like clientHello and serverHello among them.                Flow metadata, the sequences of packet length and time, and byte distribution also contributed to malware fingerprinting.                That academic work, or something an awful lot like it, has now appeared in a product as Encrypted Traffic Analysis (ETA), which watches three characteristics that Cisco says provide enough information to spot malware

- Those three factors are:                The initial data packet in the connection;The sequence of packet lengths and times, which Cisco's post says offers vital clues into traffic contents beyond the beginning of the encrypted flow; andByte distribution across packet payloads within a flow, a detection process that improves over time, because it helps build machine learning models.                The first ETA offering uses NetFlow information from Cisco's Catalyst 9000 switches and its 4000 series Integrated Services Routers, integrated with Cisco StealthWatch security analytics.                Swichzilla says its newest silicon means ETA can run without hogging resources and slowing traffic

-

## Tor descriptors a la carte: Tor Metrics Library 2

-  We're often asked by researchers, users, and journalists for Tor network data

- How can you find out how many people use the Tor network daily? How many relays make up the network? How many times has Tor Browser been downloaded in your language? In order to get to these answers from archived data, we have to continuously fetch, parse, and evaluate Tor descriptors

- We do this with the Tor Metrics Library.Today, the Tor Metrics Team is proud to announce major improvements and launch Tor Metrics Library version 2.0.0

- These improvements, supported by a Mozilla Open Source Support (MOSS) Mission Partners award, enhance our ability to monitor the performance and stability of the Tor network.From internal tool to public resource Originally, the library was an internal tool

- We used it to fetch the latest descriptors archived by CollecTor in all Java-based codebases and to parse descriptors that had been published by Tor relays, bridges, directory authorities, and other parts of the public Tor network.Over the years, we've added more data sources and made it into a publicly-available resource

- Our data has been used in many ad-hoc analyses, as well as in Atlas, ExoneraTor, and Tor Metrics.Better memory-efficiency, fewer bugs This launch adds numerous improvements, from interface simplifications over memory-efficiency improvements to added support for newly-added descriptor parts and, last but not least, bugfixes

- You can check out the change log for a complete overview.A few months ago, the library found a home on the recently-reorganized Tor Metrics website

- Here you'll find tutorials for getting started with the library by downloading descriptors from CollecTor and performing two simple analyses to determine the current relay capacity by Tor version and frequency of bridge transports

## WikiLeaks Exposes CIA Targeting Linux Users With OutlawCountry Network Traffic Re-Routing Tool | HotHardware

- But don't worry, the CIA has targeted Windows users en masse in the past as well; absolutely no one has proven safe and they obviously don't discriminate.

- OutlawCountry starts out as a Linux kernel module (nf_table_6_64.ko) that gets loaded into the system and subsequently creates a new entry in the iptables firewall configuration.

- After the deed is done, the original kernel module is no longer needed, so it's deleted. Excerpt from CIA's OutlawCountry guide At this point, an attacker could run an iptables command to reroute all of the traffic through a designated CIA data mining server, allowing the agency to spy on user activities and communications.

- The biggest threat here isn't winding up with the attack on a home PC, but more so a web server that could have thousands or even millions of people routing through it. What's not clear at this point, is how the CIA expected to infect computers with this malware.

- Falling victim to this particular attack, given its implementation, would pose almost no risk being sent as an email attachment, unless it was packaged as a script and still somehow managed to be run with root access. OutlawCountry is just one of the many CIA leaks that WikiLeaks has released out as part of its Vault 7 series of data dumps, which have had more than a dozen separate leaks since the first back in March of this year.

## AMD Launches Ryzen PRO CPUs: Enhanced Security, Longer Warranty, Better Quality

-                 This morning AMD is introducing their Ryzen PRO processors for business and commercial desktop PCs

- The new lineup of CPUs includes the Ryzen 3 PRO, Ryzen 5 PRO and Ryzen 7 PRO families with four, six, or eight cores running at various frequencies

- A superset to the standard Ryzen chips, the PRO chips have the same feature set as other Ryzen devices, but also offer enhanced security, 24 months availability, a longer warranty and promise to feature better chip quality.AMD Ryzen Pro: The Family PortraitThe AMD Ryzen PRO lineup of processors consists of six SKUs that belong to the Ryzen 7, Ryzen 5 and Ryzen 3 families targeting different market segments and offering different levels of performance

- As one would expect, the Ryzen 7 PRO models are aimed at workstation applications and thus have all eight cores with simultaneous multithreading enabled, the Ryzen 5 PROmodels  are designed for advanced mainstream desktops and therefore have four or six cores with SMT, whereas the Ryzen 3 PRO models are aimed at office workloads that work well on quad-core CPUs without SMT

- The specifications of the Ryzen 7 PRO and the Ryzen 5 PRO resemble those of regular Ryzen processors

- Meanwhile, the Ryzen 3 PRO are the first chips from the Ryzen 3 lineup and thus give us a general idea what to expect from such products: four cores without SMT operating at 3.1  3.5 GHz base frequency along with 2+8 MB of cache.AMD Ryzen PRO Specifications Cores/ThreadsFrequencyCacheTDPBaseBoostL2L3Ryzen 7 PRO 1700X8/163.5 GHz3.7 GHz4 MB16 MB95 WRyzen 7 PRO 17003 GHz3.7 GHz65 WRyzen 5 PRO 16006/123.2 GHz3.6 GHz3 MBRyzen 5 PRO 15004/83.5 GHz3.7 GHz2 MBRyzen 3 PRO 13004/43.5 GHz3.7 GHz8 MBRyzen 3 PRO 12004/43.1 GHz3.4 GHzJust like other Ryzen CPUs, all the Ryzen PRO chips fully support ECC technology, but with certain limitations when it comes to data transfer rates and memory modules  these are peculiarities of the controller and the PRO moniker cannot change them

- One of the things to note is that AMD used only DDR4-2400 memory for their internal testing of the Ryzen PRO CPUs, thus, expect PC makers to use the same speed DRAM for their desktops as well.In fact, when it comes to their general feature set, all of the AMD Ryzen PRO CPUs support the same capabilities as their non-PRO brethren do, including AMDs SenseMi, Precision Boost, Extended Frequency Range, Neural Net Prediction and so on

- There is even the AMD Ryzen 7 PRO 1700X CPU in the lineup, completely with its extended performance and 95 W TDP (the first for any AMD PRO platform)

## This Windows Defender bug was so gaping its PoC exploit had to be encrypted

- That's according to Tavis Ormandy, the Google Project Zero researcher who discovered the vulnerability and explained it in a report published Friday.

- " In an advisory that was also published Friday, Microsoft officials said attackers who exploited the vulnerability could execute arbitrary code that would run with the rights of a LocalSystem account.

- Exploiting the memory corruption bug in the Windows Defender emulator, an attacker could take control of the system and perform a variety of tasks, including installing programs, viewing, changing, or deleting data, as well as creating new accounts with full user rights. Warning, this file may crash your server As a testament to the ease of triggering the bug, Ormandy took special precautions in publishing some of the proof-of-concept exploits, which were linked to a file named testcase.txt.

- Ormandy called the flaw "the worst Windows remote code exec in recent memory," and he warned that attacks "work against a default install, don't need to be on the same LAN, and [they're] wormable.

- At the same time, AV in many cases prevents infections that would otherwise prove costly, particularly for less experienced users who aren't likely to be individually targeted by state-sponsored hackers. This post was updated to add comment from Microsoft.

## Advanced CIA firmware has been infecting Wi-Fi routers for years

- Home routers from 10 manufacturers, including Linksys, DLink, and Belkin, can be turned into covert listening posts that allow the Central Intelligence Agency to monitor and manipulate incoming and outgoing traffic and infect connected devices.

- What sets the CIA implant apart the most is its full suite of features, including its user interface, command-server support, and a long list of mission tasks.

- CherryBlossom is the latest release in WikiLeaks Vault7 series, which the site purports was made possible when the "CIA lost control of the majority of its hacking arsenal."

- CIA officials have declined to confirm or deny the authenticity of the documents, but based on the number of pages and unique details exposed in the series, there is broad consensus among researchers that the documents are actual CIA materials. What's more, researchers from security firm Symantec have definitively linked at least one Vault7 release to an advanced hacking operation that has been penetrating governments and private industries around the world for years.

- That makes the leaks significantly less damaging than those by the Shadow Brokers, the name used by a still-unknown group that has been published advanced hacking tools developed by and later stolen from the National Security Agency.

## How to defend your website with ZIP bombs

-  [update] I'm on some list now that I have written an article about some kind of "bomb", ain't I?

- If you have ever hosted a website or even administrated a server you'll be very well aware of bad people trying bad things with your stuff. When I first hosted my own little linux box with SSH access at age 13 I read through the logs daily and report the IPs (mostly from China and Russia) who tried to connect to my sweet little box (which was actually an old ThinkPad T21 with a broken display running under my bed) to their ISPs. Actually if you have a linux server with SSH exposed you can see how many connection attempts are made every day: grep 'authentication failures' /var/log/auth.log Hundreds of failed login attempts even though this server has disabled password authentication and runs on a non-standard port Wordpress has doomed us all Ok to be honest, web vulnerability scanners have existed before Wordpress but since WP is so widely deployed most web vuln scanners include scans for some misconfigured wp-admin folders or unpatched plugins. So if a small, new hacking group wants to gain some hot cred they'll download one of these scanner things and start testing against many websites in hopes of gaining access to a site and defacing it. Sample of a log file during a scan using the tool Nikto This is why all server or website admins have to deal with gigabytes of logs full with scanning attempts.

- So I was wondering.. Is there a way to strike back? After going through some potential implementations with IDS or Fail2ban I remembered the old ZIP bombs from the old days. WTH is a ZIP bomb? So it turns out ZIP compression is really good with repetitive data so if you have a really huge text file which consists of repetitive data like all zeroes, it will compress it really good.

- When you try to actually look at the content (extract or decompress it) then you'll most likely run out of disk space or RAM. How can I ZIP bomb a vuln scanner? Sadly, web browsers don't understand ZIP, but they do understand GZIP. So firstly we'll have to create the 10 giga byte GZIP file filled with zeroes.

- Edge Memory rises, then dripps and loads forever

## The RNC Files: Inside the Largest US Voter Data Leak

- The data, which was stored in a publicly accessible cloud server owned by Republican data firm Deep Root Analytics, included 1.1 terabytes of entirely unsecured personal information compiled by DRA and at least two other Republican contractors, TargetPoint Consulting, Inc. and Data Trust.

- In total, the personal information of potentially near all of Americas 200 million registered voters was exposed, including names, dates of birth, home addresses, phone numbers, and voter registration details, as well as data described as modeled voter ethnicities and religions.

- An additional 24 terabytes of data was stored in the warehouse

- Starting with the potential voters first and last nameslimiting even the barest possibility of the data sets masking the identities of those describedthe files go on to list a great deal more data, including the voters date of birth, home and mailing addresses, phone number, registered party, self-reported racial demographic, voter registration status, and even whether they are on the federal Do Not Call list

## GhostHook Attack Targets Windows 10 Vulnerability

- Last week, CyberArk Labs demonstrated an attack that can enable the installation of rootkit malware under Windows 10 64-bit. The proof-of-concept attack overrides the operating system's PatchGuard feature.

- Microsoft's PatchGuard was designed to prevent malicious code from patching the kernel of 64-bit Windows operating systems

- This technique is about moving beyond admin rights and exploiting the machine at the kernel level

## Special Publication 800-63

- Read NISTs Digital Identity Guidelines!More than a year in the making, and after a large, cross-industry effort, NIST is proud to announce the new SP 800-63.GitHubThe basicsThe Special Publication (SP) 800-63 suite provides technical requirements for federal agencies implementing digital identity services

- The publication includes: an overview of identity frameworks; using authenticators, credentials, and assertions in a digital system; and a risk-based process to select assurance levels

- Organizations have the flexibility to choose the appropriate assurance level for their needs.SP 800-63 comprises a suite of documents that can be used independently or in concert to meet identity needs.The suite               0  SP 800-63-3: Digital Identity GuidelinesGitHub  PDF               0  SP 800-63A: Enrollment  Identity ProofingGitHub  PDF              0  SP 800-63B: Authentication  Lifecycle ManagementGitHub  PDF              0  SP 800-63C: Federation  AssertionsGitHub  PDF Changes to 800-63 since the last versionFor the new SP 800-63, NIST sought to simplify and clarify guidance, better align with commercial markets, promote international interoperability, and focus on outcomes (where possible) to promote innovation and deployment flexibility

- Furthermore, the updates in this publication give relying parties latitude in designing, building, consuming, and procuring identity technology.Highlights:Broke down level of assurance into its independent parts: identity proofing, authenticators, and federated assertionsCreated multiple volumes with clear distinctions between normative and informative language, so each volume is a one-stop shop for mandatory requirements and recommended approachesGave identity proofing a major overhaul, with support from UK and Canadian peers; guidance supports in-person proofing over a virtual channel, though under a strict set of requirementsClarified that knowledge-based verification is limited to specific portions of the identity proofing process and never sufficient on its ownPlaced additional restrictions on the use of SMS for a one-time password (OTP) and removed OTP via emailAddressed the security required for centralized biometric matchingUpdated terminology to clarify language across the identity spaceApproach    Comments on GitHub and unique visitors to the web version of the SP        0  NIST has co-developed SP 800-63-3 with the community (feedback was solicited via GitHub and email)  to ensure that it helps organizations implement effective digital identity services, reflects available technologies in the market, and makes room for innovations on the horizon

- GitHub has enabled NIST to engage the community in near-real-time to more efficiently create a better product

- The SP 800-63 update process included multiple iterations and opportunities for stakeholders to weigh in on the document.Before NIST released SP 800-63 as final, community participation in drafting the publication resulted in 1,400+ commentsand the web version of the publication drew 74,000+ unique visitors between May 2016 and May 2017.Learn morePublic draft informational webinar  video  slidesSource information, current standards, and public comments received through May 2015  moreRelated blog postsMic Drop  Announcing the New Special Publication 800-63 Suite!

## Stack Clash Vulnerability in Linux, BSD Systems Enables Root Access

- Linux, BSD, Solaris and other open source systems are vulnerable to a local privilege escalation vulnerability known as Stack Clash that allows an attacker to execute code at root.

- Major Linux and open source distributors have made patches available today, and systems running Linux, OpenBSD, NetBSD, FreeBSD or Solaris on i386 or amd64 hardware should be updated soon.

## Gathering weak npm credentials

- This is not a false alarm  your password being revoked basically means that I was able to obtain it by some of the means described in this note (though neither of those involve npm directly). Basically any other person with an internet access (including malicious players) can also do that.

- You packaged your npm credentials inside an npm package  in this case, npm now revokes your credentials automatically.

- You published your token/password online yourself, e.g. uploaded it to a public GitHub repo, saved it in the CI logs, pasted to GitHub Gist, or did something similar.

- You were using a very weak password  though the extent to what I tried matching that depended on the overall downloads/month that you control, all of those were at the top part of weak password lists.

- You were reusing an old password that leaked from another site (e.g. through breaches, phishing, or anything) and your login+password or email+password combination is present in the public databases that basically anyone could download, and that could be used by malicious players.

## NASA Is Going To Crash a Satellite Into an Asteroid

- The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) is moving ahead with plans to try out deflection techniques on a passing asteroid to prepare for future, threatening space matter.

- From a report: The space agency has entered the preliminary design phase for its Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART).

- This represents the first trial of what's called the "kinetic impactor technique" of asteroid deflection.

- Put another way, NASA hopes that by hurling a refrigerator-sized spacecraft at one of the space rocks at a speed roughly nine times that of a bullet, it can knock the asteroid off course and save the Earth.

- By striking one of the two asteroids, scientists will be able to measure the impact of the collision.

## tor - Tor's source code

- = Fuzzing Tor== The simple version (no fuzzing, only tests)Check out fuzzing-corpora, and set TOR_FUZZ_CORPORA to point to the placewhere you checked it out.To run the fuzzing test cases in a deterministic fashion, use:      make test-fuzz-corporaThis won't actually fuzz Tor!  It will just run all the fuzz binarieson our existing set of testcases for the fuzzer.== Different kinds of fuzzingRight now we support three different kinds of fuzzer.First, there's American Fuzzy Lop (AFL), a fuzzer that works by forkinga target binary and passing it lots of different inputs on stdin

- It's thetrickiest one to set up, so I'll be describing it more below.Second, there's libFuzzer, a llvm-based fuzzer that you link in as a library,and it runs a target function over and over

- To use this one, you'll need tohave a reasonably recent clang and libfuzzer installed

- At that point, youjust build with --enable-expensive-hardening and --enable-libfuzzer

- Thatwill produce a set of binaries in src/test/fuzz/lf-fuzz-*

- These programstake as input a series of directories full of fuzzing examples

- For moreinformation on libfuzzer, see http://llvm.org/docs/LibFuzzer.htmlThird, there's Google's OSS-Fuzz infrastructure, which expects to get all ofits

- For more on this, see https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz and theprojects/tor subdirectory

## A container identity bootstrapping tool

-             Everybody has secrets

- Software developers have many

- Often these secretsAPI tokens, TLS private keys, database passwords, SSH keys, and other sensitive dataare needed to make a service run properly and interact securely with other services

- Today were sharing a tool that we built at Cloudflare to securely distribute secrets to our Dockerized production applications: PAL.PAL is available on Github: https://github.com/cloudflare/pal

- Although PAL is not currently under active development, we have found it a useful tool and we think the community will benefit from its source being available

- We believe that it's better to open source this tool and allow others to use the code than leave it hidden from view and unmaintained.Secrets in production  How do you get these secrets to your services? If youre the only developer, or one of a few on a project, you might put the secrets with your source code in your version control system

- But if you just store the secrets in plain text with your code, everyone with access to your source repository can read them and use them for nefarious purposes (for example, stealing an API token and pretending to be an authorized client)

- Furthermore, distributed version control systems like Git will download a copy of the secret everywhere a repository is cloned, regardless of whether its needed there, and will keep that copy in the commit history forever
