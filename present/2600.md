## Tor 0.3.0.6 is released: a new series is stable! | The Tor Blog

- With the 0.3.0 series, clients and relays now use Ed25519 keys to authenticate their link connections to relays, rather than the old RSA1024 keys that they used before

- We have also replaced the guard selection and replacement algorithm to behave more robustly in the presence of unreliable networks, and to resist guard- capture attacks.

- directory authorities will reject relays where the RSA identity key matches a previously seen value, but the Ed25519 key has changed. Closes ticket 18319.

- Tor's guard selection algorithm has been redesigned from the ground up, to better support unreliable networks and restrictive sets of entry nodes, and to better resist guard-capture attacks by hostile local networks

- Change the algorithm used to decide DNS TTLs on client and server side, to better resist DNS-based correlation attacks like the DefecTor attack of Greschbach, Pulls, Roberts, Winter, and Feamster. Now relays only return one of two possible DNS TTL values, and clients are willing to believe DNS TTL values up to 3 hours long

- OSS-Fuzz.

- Allow relays to accept a wider range of ciphersuites, including chacha20-poly1305 and AES-CCM

## Checklist-Driven Security Considered Harmful

- When someone attempts to secure an application or a network using a checklist, they're committing the second fallacy in that list: "Enumerating Badness.

- ) Until recently, a few checklists were given a pass because they were generally considered reputable among information security professionals.

- A weak random generator could become a potent backdoor. The problem isn't that the team behind OWASP is corrupt or incompetent.

- I trust that the security industry at large can refine this proposal, going forward. Building a taxonomy model for vulnerability classification has a lot of advantages over a checklist. You can teach software developers the core fundamental lessons of each major classification ("don't let user input alter the program in any way", "make sure your logic is sound", "keep your software up-to-date and well configured", "cryptography requires expert care").

- This transforms vulnerability mitigation from "here's another item to memorize and hopefully apply when you develop software under time pressure" into "here's a slightly more specific instance of the core lesson, so if you forget how to prevent these specific vulnerabilities, you'll probably remember the core lesson". Additionally, like security research itself, a taxonomy isn't ever really "finished".

## Antbleed: Bitcoin's Newest New Controversy Explained

- For example, the vulnerability reveal follows allegations that the manufacturer was using a secret mining advantage to boost its profits. In conversation with CoinDesk, Bitcoin Unlimited chief scientist Peter Rizun might have summed up the issue and surrounding atmosphere the best: "The drama in social media today surrounds the question of whether there exists a security hole that would allow this remote-control feature to be exploited for nefarious purposes.

- " Code details Still, it seems that there are other reasons to be concerned about the backdoor. Since it can be exploited by bad actors from outside the company, the mining chips are now viewed as a security risk to the network.

- Every one to 11 minutes, according to the open-source patch introduced on July 12th, 2016, the machines send calls back to a Bitmain server. The idea is that the mining manufacturer can scan for identifying information about the mining chip, including its serial number and IP address. But, arguably the biggest concern is that the code isn't limited to use by certain people or companies, so it can be exploited by any man-in-the-middle or attacks coming from the same DNS server. "Even without Bitmain being malicious, the API is unauthenticated and would allow any MITM, DNS or domain hijack to shut down Antminers globally," the Antbleed website reads, further outlining concerns about the potential for technical or political misuse. Vulnerability or 'malicious' backdoor? Whether or not it was intended to be malicious seems to make up the bulk of the surrounding debate, and so far, it seems that sentiment has broken along the lines of the scaling debate. Still, some broke away from so-called party lines. "This was reckless of them to leave the unfinished feature in the code since this represents a major security issue," said Henry Brade, CEO of bitcoin service provider Prasos, a past defender of Bitcoin Cores scaling proposals. "However, based on the statement it is not accurate to call 'Antbleed' malicious in nature.

- The purpose of the code is clear; shut down miner on remote flag," Palatinus tweeted. Public info? Others have raised concerns about this vulnerability being made public, since outsiders can then take advantage of the attack vector. Bitcoin Core contributor Matt Corallo argued that owners of these bitcoin miners needed to know about the potential vulnerability in order to fix it. "The issue is it's already integrated in a ton of deployed hardware," he said, adding: "It was reported to Bitmain via that bug report months ago, and their customers need to know to protect their operations from potential [man-in-the-middle attacks].

- Two mining manufacturers, at least, claim that they dont. "Our hardware doesn't [have] such issues, we [dont] offer remote update for firmware  it's the customer's decision update them or not, said blockchain startup Bitfury Group CIO Alex Petrov. "My miner has no ASICBoost or backdoor," Jack Liao, CEO of mining LightningAsic, told CoinDesk. Along with the details about the backdoor, those who detected it released a patch that closes it up with a single line of code. Mining centralization Still, there are lingering worries that the vulnerability betrays a weakness in the bitcoin network  namely, it's lack of mining chip makers. No clear data is available about how many miners are running this software, but Bitmain is one the largest chip manufacturers in the space, with bolder estimates suggesting it produces 70% of all mining chips. That the backdoor could be used to impact any of those chips is unsurprisingly alarming to advocates that the network be "decentralized" and open to competition that enables different actors to engage on it. For now, the impact seems to be that Bitmain will take action to look at the rest of its codebase in order to spot other vulnerabilities. "The controversy around this code has brought our attention to improve the design in order to address vulnerabilities that were pointed out by the community recently," its statement reads. Still, others are lamenting the state of the drama and conversation around the issue, noting how quickly it became politicized. Rizun concluded: "All-in-all just another day in bitcoin.

## Google Earth Gets a New Home On the Web

- 90542743story Google Earth Gets a New Home On the Web  (arstechnica.com)   To celebrate the Earth Day, Google says it is rolling out what was a two-year in the making major update to Google Earth

- From a report: V9 is designed to run in a Web browser (just Chrome for now), but there's now a standalone home for Google Earth

- The Android app has been updated, too (iOS is coming soon)

- Version 9 puts a big focus on guided tours via the "Voyager" section, which serves as a jumping off point for YouTube videos, 360-degree content, Street View, and Google Earth landmarks

- The tours are led by scientists and documentarians, with some content produced by well-known groups like the BBC's Planet Earth team

- For kids, there's a Sesame Street muppet section.

## Ubuntu Is Switching to Wayland

- 90568937story Ubuntu Is Switching to Wayland  (omgubuntu.co.uk)   An anonymous reader shares a report: Ubuntu is to ship Wayland in place of X.Org Server by default

- Mir, Canonical's home-spun alternative to Wayland, had been billed as the future of Ubuntu's convergence play

- But both Unity 8 the convergence dream was recently put out to pasture, meaning this decision was widely expected

- It's highly likely that the traditional X.Org Server will, as on Fedora, be included on the disc and accessible from whichever login screen Ubuntu devs opt to use in ubuntu 17.10 onwards

- This session will be useful for users whose system experience issues running on Wayland, or who need features and driver support that is only present in the legacy X.Org server session.

## 107 Cancer Papers Retracted Due To Peer Review Fraud

- An anonymous reader quotes a report from Ars Technica: The journal Tumor Biology is retracting 107 research papers after discovering that the authors faked the peer review process.

- Late last year, 58 papers were retracted from seven different journals -- 25 came from Tumor Biology for the same reason.

- If the editor isn't aware of the potential for a scam, they then merrily send the requests for review out to fake e-mail addresses, often using the names of actual researchers.

- According to an official statement from Springer, the company that published Tumor Biology until this year, "the decision was made to screen new papers before they are released to production."

- The extra screening turned up the names of fake reviewers that hadn't previously been detected, and "in order to clean up our scientific records, we will now start retracting these affected articles...Springer will continue to proactively investigate these issues."

## Linux PC Maker System76 Plans To Design And Manufacture Its Own Hardware

-  Linux PC Maker System76 Plans To Design And Manufacture Its Own Hardware  (liliputing.com) 

- An anonymous reader quotes Liliputing: System76 is one of only a handful of PC vendors that exclusively sells computers with Linux-based software.

- Up until now, that's meant the company has chosen hardware that it could guarantee would work well with custom firmware and the Ubuntu Linux operating system...

- Starting in 2018 though, you may be able to buy a System76 computer that was designed and built in-house... CAD files for System76 computers will be open source, allowing anyone with the appropriate skills and equipment to build or modify their own cases based on the company's designs.  "We're prototyping with acrylic and moving to metal soon," the company says in a blog post, adding "Our first in-house designed and manufactured desktops will ship next year.

- Laptops are more complex and will follow much later.

## Amazon Wants To Put a Camera and Microphone in Your Bedroom

- 90704053story Amazon Wants To Put a Camera and Microphone in Your Bedroom  (vice.com)   On Wednesday, Amazon announced the Echo Look, the latest gadget in the company's new Echo-powered hardware lineup

- Motherboard explains: The newly announced Echo Look is a virtual assistant with a microphone and a camera that's designed to go somewhere in your bedroom, bathroom, or wherever the hell you get dressed

- Amazon is pitching it as an easy way to snap pictures of your outfits to send to your friends when you're not sure if your outfit is cute, but it's also got a built-in app called StyleCheck that is worth some further dissection

- [...] "All photos and video captured with your Echo Look are securely stored in the AWS cloud and locally in the Echo Look app until a customer deletes them," a spokesperson for the company said

- "You can delete the photos or videos associated with your account anytime in the Echo Look App." Motherboard also asked if Echo Look photos, videos, and the data gleaned from them would be sold to third parties; the company did not address that question.

## Chinas Latest VPN Crackdown

- Throughout China, internet users have long been forced to rely on circumvention technologies to access blocked websites

- Leaping over the Great Firewall is a necessity for Chinese netizens seeking unbiased news coverage, businesses operating in the global marketplace, scholars conducting academic research, and regular Chinese users connecting to worldwide social media platforms, for example.But for residents of the southwestern city of Chongqing, a new regulation stands to further limit options for unfettered internet access

- Chongqings roughly 50 million residents learned last week of an order outlawing the use of online circumvention technology, specifically VPNs (virtual private networks)

- The regulation technically came into effect in July 2016 but was only publicized last week.Chongqings New VPN Regulations Make VPNs Illegal, Punish UsersChina has cracked down on VPN use before, especially during politically sensitive times

- But what is different and most striking about the Chongqing regulation is the move to punish individual VPN users as opposed to the organizations and companies providing the service.Under the new rules, any individual caught using circumvention tools will receive a warning and be ordered to log off

- Entrepreneurial netizens leaping over the Great Firewall to turn a profit greater than 5,000 yuan ($725 USD) will be hit with a fine of at least 5,000 yuan

- Chinas repressive media environment has actually created a market for information smugglers who gather blocked content, translate it, and redistribute for mainland audiences.The Chongqing regulation follows a nationwide notice handed down by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology in January mandating that all VPN providers be required to obtain government approval in order to operate, rendering nearly all VPNs illegal

- This clean-up of the internet will run through March 2018.Internet Shutdowns and More in Xinjiang, Tibet, and Outside ChinaUsers in Chongqing are not the only ones in China facing heightened and specific targeting for their online activities

## We're spying on you for your own protection, says NSA, FBI

- The law gave the intelligence agencies the right to demand that US companies hand over their communications in the search for foreign intelligence. In an effort to ensure that those searches were restricted to non-US citizens however, the FAA  which was re-authorized in 2012 and now needs to be re-authorized again before the end of 2017  included various procedures, and checks and balances. Somewhat inevitably however, those procedures  which remain almost entirely secret  and the check and balances  which have been shown to be ineffective at best  have been slowly undermined by the intelligence agencies to the extent that the FBI now routinely uses personally identifiable information of US citizens, such as an email or phone number, to search a huge database of gathered information if it suspects them of a crime carried out in the US. That reality is the diametric opposite of what the law was intended to do  hence the ludicrous contradictions between what the intelligence agencies say the law authorizes and the everyday realities that they argue must be retained. Walk me through it The first eight pages of the 10-page document are largely accurate, giving a rundown of the law, its history and intentions, and the procedures and checks introduced.

- The independent board, the document claims, largely exonerated the intelligence agencies and "made a number of recommendations" that have "been implemented in full or in part by the government.

- These critical documents remain entirely secret. The PCLOB also paid a high price for standing up to the NSA and FBI: they had their authority cut out from under them, the budget was slashed, and all but one of its five board members have either resigned or have not had their terms renewed.

- " Note that the database goes from only gathering foreign intelligence to searching for evidence of a crime carried out in the United States by a US citizen in just 14 words. How on earth it is possible to legally justify such a position?

- " Of course what that justification does not address is how the "tasked selector" was identified in the tapping of the internet backbone when it neither came from the individual they were targeting, nor was delivered to them. This makes a mockery of the claim that Section 702 is only used for targeted surveillance and instead looks as though the NSA is gathering all possible information and searching within it, which inevitably means the gathering of huge amounts of data on US citizens  the very thing the law is supposed to avoid. The FISC claim is difficult to discern due to continued secrecy of its functioning and its decisions. But perhaps the most extraordinary claim in the whole document is that spying on US citizens is for their own protection. "Queries using US person identifiers in Section 702 collection," it reads, "can assist the IC in identifying situations where a US person may be the subject of an imminent threat, with the goal of protecting the US person from harm.

- In that same category (useful  fun) you can add: MDMA, psilocybin mushrooms, mescaline, DMT, cannabis and a lot of other entheogens.If you do your research, you will find all of these have applications for disorders/ailments like OCD, PTSD, alcoholism, depression, cluster headaches, anxiety disorders and various physical ailments (cannabis particularly)

- Deaths from all of the above combined are minimal, and zero with regard to cannabis.So, the DEA is the "fun police" and most of these substances should not be regulated at all

- But, since they pose a threat to corporate interests, we have the ludicrous "Controlled Substances Act"."Truly dangerous" is the amphetamine and opioid classes (although even they have their valid uses in various cases), alcohol, tobacco, and legal pharmaceuticals like fentanyl (which kill FAR more people than street drugs - check any recent references)

- Also, they are as addictive as hell.Virtually nobody ever got 'hooked' on LSD or other psychedelics - tolerance increases rapidly, and the death numbers are miniscule

- A few who 'tripped the light fantastic' didn't fully come back, true, but maybe they shouldn't have eaten a sheet of tabs in the first place.The DEA is fighting the wrong war, and is on the wrong side of history

## Murdered Woman's Fitbit Nails Cheating Husband

-  Murdered Woman's Fitbit Nails Cheating Husband  (nydailynews.com) 

- BarbaraHudson writes: A murdered woman's Fitbit data shows she was still alive an hour after her husband claims she was murdered and he was tied up, contradicting her husband's description of events.

- New York Daily News reports: "Richard Dabate, 40, was charged this month with felony murder, tampering with physical evidence and making false statements following his wife Connie's December 2015 death at their home in Ellington, Tolland County.

- Dabate called 911 reporting that his wife was the victim of a home invasion, alleging that she was shot dead by a 'tall, obese man' with a deep voice like actor Vin Diesel's, sporting 'camouflage and a mask,' according to an arrest warrant.

- Dabate alleged her death took place more than an hour before her Fitbit-tracked movements revealed.

## Discontinuing the hardened Tor Browser series

-  When we started with the hardened Tor Browser series 18 months ago, we had two main purposes in mind:  It should give users an even more secure Tor Browser, especially at higher security levels where JavaScript is partially or completely disabled.

- It should help us to identify issues earlier, therefore allowing to develop and backport fixes to the Tor Browser alpha and stable series.

- Moreover, just using the hardening options provided by the toolchain seemed to be an incomplete solution to the problema bandaid until we could provide a more complete approach to hardening. Looking again at its purposes above, we think it is safe to say that the hardened series indeed helped us identifying issues early on: with it we found bugs both in Firefox and tor and they got resolved quickly. The picture is not so clear with respect to the promised security benefits.

- It seems we underestimated the confusion among users caused by labeling the series as "hardened" while at the same time including features for debugging purposes as well.

- The resulting experimental character of this series made it hard for users to decide whether that's actually the Tor Browser they wanted to have or not. Where does that leave us?

## Transparency, Openness, and our 2015 Financials

-   Transparency, Openness, and our 2015 Financials                    Posted April 21st, 2017 by arma                       After completing the standard audit, our 2015 state and federal tax filings are available

- We publish all of our related tax documents because we believe in transparency.I'm sorry for the delay in posting them: we had everything ready in December, but we had a lot going on at the end of the year (if you haven't seen it yet, check out the Tor at the Heart of Internet Freedom blog post series!), and then time got away from me after the new year.But the delay brings you something new! Linus Nordberg, one of our new board members, has gathered together a bunch of corporate documents, like the Articles of Organization from founding the organization, our Form 1023 where we applied for non-profit status, and our IRS determination letter where they confirmed it

- I've put links to these documents on the same financials page.From a development perspective, transparency doesn't just mean that we show you our source code (though of course we do)

- The second layer to transparency is publishing specifications to explain what we thought we implemented in the source code

- And the layer above that is publishing design documents and research papers to explain why we chose to build it that way, including analyzing the security implications and the tradeoffs of alternate designs

- The reason for all these layers is to help people evaluate every level of our system: whether we chose the right design, whether we turned that design into a concrete plan that will keep people safe, and whether we correctly implemented this plan

- Tor gets a huge amount of analysis and attention from professors and university research groups down to individual programmers around the world, and this consistent peer review is one of our core strengths over the past decade.Some observations to help you read through the 2015 financial documents:Tor's annual revenue in 2015 was up from 2014, at almost $3.3 million

- That's good news because it shows our stability in the year where I was interim executive director

## If you've stayed at a Holiday Inn you may have lost more than a good night's sleep (like maybe your bank card)

- In February, Intercontinental Hotels Group alerted customers that some of its US locations had been infected with credit-card-stealing malware.

- Now it has admitted the cyber-outbreak is much worse than first thought. IHG, which owns brands like Holiday Inn and Crown Plaza, has warned that around 1,200 of its hotels across the US and Puerto Rico have been hit by the same sales terminal malware  which grabs card data from the computers' memory as payments are made.

- The infections were spotted on September 29, 2016 but the infections weren't cleared up until March 2017, and some hotels might still have a problem. "The malware searched for track data (which sometimes has cardholder name in addition to card number, expiration date, and internal verification code) read from the magnetic stripe of a payment card as it was being routed through the affected hotel server," IHG said today.

- " The hotelier said that many of its locations were unaffected because they had installed a security mechanism called Secure Payment Solution that blocked the spyware from reading off sensitive card data  however, many hotels hadn't gotten the system up and running in time. Since it is a franchise operation it's up to the hotel owner to install the more secure system, and there are worries that not all of them have the system installed even now. IHG has set up a web page with a full list of affected hotels, and it's a very long list.

- The US is, after all, the land of the lawsuit, and lawyers are no doubt salivating at the chance to launch a class action suit against some of the best-known hotel brands in the country.

## Phishing with Unicode Domains - Xudong Zheng

- Posted by Xudong Zheng on April 14, 2017Before I explain the details of the vulnerability, you should take alook at theproof-of-concept.Punycode makes itpossible to register domains with foreign characters

- It works byconverting individual domain label to an alternative format using onlyASCII characters

- For example, the domain "xn--s7y.co" is equivalent to".co".From a security perspective, Unicode domains can be problematicbecause many Unicode characters are difficult to distinguish from commonASCII characters

- It is possible to register domains such as"xn--pple-43d.com", which is equivalent to "pple.com"

- It may not beobvious at first glance, but "pple.com" uses the Cyrillic "" (U+0430)rather than the ASCII "a" (U+0061)

- This is known as ahomograph attack.Fortunately modern browsers have mechanisms in place to limit IDNhomograph attacks

- The pageIDN in Google Chromehighlights the conditions under which an IDN is displayed in its nativeUnicode form

- Generally speaking, the Unicode form will be hidden if adomain label contains characters from multiple different languages

## AFL experiments, or please eat your brotli

- In one case, AFL-based equivalence fuzzing revealed a bunch of fairly rudimentary flaws in common bignum libraries, with some theoretical implications for crypto apps.

- Another time, output stability checks revealed long-lived issues in IJG jpeg and other widely-used image processing libraries, leaking data across web origins.

- The latter is a far more fruitful target for security research, because decompression normally involves dealing with well-formed inputs, whereas compression code is meant to accept arbitrary data and not think about it too hard.

-  In this case, the library held up admirably - spare for a handful of computationally intensive plaintext inputs (that are now easy to spot due to the recent improvements to AFL).

- The explanation is that brotli, in addition to more familiar binary coding methods, uses a static dictionary constructed by analyzing common types of web content.

## NSA-Leaking Shadow Brokers Just Dumped Its Most Damaging Release Yet

- Friday's dump contains potent exploits and hacking tools that target most versions of Microsoft Windows and evidence of sophisticated hacks on the SWIFT banking system of several banks across the world

- included compiled binaries for exploits that targeted vulnerabilities in a long line of Windows operating systems, including Windows 8 and Windows 2012

- It also included a framework dubbed Fuzzbunch, a tool that resembles the Metasploit hacking framework that loads the binaries into targeted networks

- Independent security experts who reviewed the contents said it was without question the most damaging Shadow Brokers release to date

## Remote-Access Router Exploit Finally Revealed

-  Remote-Access Router Exploit Finally Revealed  (helpnetsecurity.com) 

- "Back in the days, Cisco fixed the vulnerability, but we are not sure about all other router vendors and models because there are too many of them," writes the DefenseCode team.

- Orome1 quotes a new report from Help Net Security: Back in January 2013, researchers from application security services firm DefenseCode unearthed a remote root access vulnerability in the default installation of some Cisco Linksys (now Belkin) routers.

- The flaw was actually found in Broadcom's UPnP implementation used in popular routers, and ultimately the researchers extended the list of vulnerable routers to encompass devices manufactured by the likes of ASUS, D-Link, Zyxel, US Robotics, TP-Link, Netgear, and others.

- Since there were millions of vulnerable devices out there, the researchers refrained from publishing the exploit they created for the flaw, but now, four years later, they've released their full research again, and this time they've also revealed the exploit. The researchers pointed out that most users don't update their router's firmware  -- meaning many routers may still be vulnerable.

## Linux kernel security gurus Grsecurity oust freeloaders from castle

-                                 Linux users, the free lunch is over

- Pennsylvania-based Open Source Security on Wednesday decided to stop making test patches of Grsecurity available for free.                The software, a set of powerful Linux kernel security enhancements, includes features such as support for role-based access controls and chroot restrictions that harden Linux implementations.                Two years ago, the Linux security outfit did the same for stable patches of Grsecurity.                The company's decision to limit its open-source security software to paying sponsors stemmed from alleged misuse of Grsecurity's trademark by an undisclosed company that appears to have been Intel's Wind River.                Asked whether the company in question was Wind River, Grsecurity creator and Open Source Security president Brad Spengler, in an email to The Register, declined to comment.                In any event, when legal saber-rattling failed to produce the desired result, Spengler's company closed its free software spigot, except for test patches.                Now those too have been paywalled

- And as a consequence, there will be no more public PaX patches for future kernel releases, because PaX includes Grsecurity contributions.                Organizations willing to pay the subscription fee  which once started at $200 per month but is now tailored on a per-customer basis  will be able to continue to benefit from Grsecurity patches.                Freeloaders will have to explore other options, which Open Source Security contends don't exist.                "Unfortunately, in contrast to Microsoft's post-Windows XP Trustworthy Computing initiative which drastically changed its security trajectory, the Linux community at large has failed to invest adequately in security over the past two decades," the company said in a blog post.                "Partially due to this, there is no direct alternative to Grsecurity or even any option that provides a substantial fraction of Grsecurity's features or overall benefits."                Asked whether he had anything to add to the announcement, Spengler pointed to a post from security researcher Jonathan Zdziarski as representative of his thoughts on the matter, and added:                All I would say other than that at this time is that I've spent nearly half of my life (16 out of 34 years) on this work and published it for free for people to learn and benefit from

- The testimonial we added to the site today from Tavis Ormandy speaks to the impact we've had on our field.There are many commentators and complainers today, especially when it involves free software, and very few people dedicating half of their life to creating useful original work

- When those efforts suddenly get co-opted by companies using misleading marketing and essentially corporate-funded plagiarism, it's not conducive to the desire to create and publish new work

- So we're refocusing our efforts back to those who respect and value our time.                To date and going forward, Grsecurity's patches are and will be distributed under the GPLv2 free-software license, just like the Linux kernel

- You could, therefore, pay for future code and release it for everyone, but that would be a surefire way to end your Grsecurity subscription for good

-

## Peace in our time! Symantec says it can end Google cert spat

- Symantec is hoping to get its certificates back on Google's trust list.

- Google decided in December 2015 to distrust the company's 'Class 3 Public Primary CA' root certificate

- Things went quiet for a while, but in January Google started another investigation, turned up an alleged 30,000 dodgy certs, and decided to sin-bin Symantec.

- Rather than have Chrome remove Extended Validation status from Symantec certs, the company offers a third-party audit of all its EV certs, to be completed by August 31, 2017;

- Another third-party audit will cover all active certificates issued by partners, including CrossCert, Certisign, Certsuperior and Certisur;

- A third WebTrust audit will cover December 1, 2016 to May 31, 2017, and after that, Symantec will conduct WebTrust audits quarterly;

- Audits will be reported quarterly;

## FTC urged to probe easily penetrated telly-enabled teledildonic toy

-                                 The US Federal Trade Commission has been urged to launch a probe into a hackable sex toy, which is potentially exposing couples' teledildonic frolics to cyberpervs.                Earlier this month, the Siime Eye vibrator was discovered to utilise hard-coded credentials making it "trivial" for attackers to gain unauthorised access to the toy's webcam feed.                These inadequacies have led Access Now, an international internet rights group, to complain that the sale of the toy is unacceptable and constitutes unfair and deceptive trade practices.                Amie Stepanovich, the US policy manager at Access Now, said that the FTC "must send a clear message to the adult Internet of Things industry that bad security will not be tolerated

- These devices can give access to people's most private information and they are being put on the market with laughably weak security settings."                Access Now urged the FTC to investigate the $249 sex toy, stating such an investigation was "even more important given the growing trend to provide internet connectivity for sex toys and other related products without proper thought given to digital security problems."                The complaint follows another teledildonics company settling a privacy infringement lawsuit for $3.75m back in March

- Standard Innovation's internet-enabled sex toy was bashed for collecting user data, including the date, time, and duration of each session in which the toy was used.                In that instance, two settlement funds were to be established: a $3m pot for users of the app affected by its data-slurping activities, and $750,000 for purchasers of the toy itself

-

-  But when you click on the link to open the file, you are directed to grant access to an app that looks like Google Docs but is actually a program that sends spam emails to everyone youve emailed, according to a detailed outline of the attack on Reddit.

-  The practice of sending an email in order to trick someone into granting access to their personal information is called phishing, and its usually done for malicious reasons, like to steal credit card information or trick them into sharing their password.

## Don't click that Google Docs link! Gmail hijack mail spreads like wildfire

-                                 Final update If you get an email today sharing a Google Docs file with you, don't click it  you may accidentally hand over your Gmail inbox and your contacts to a mystery attacker.                The phishing campaign really kicked off in a big way on Wednesday morning, US West Coast time

- The malicious email contains what appears to be a link to a Google Doc file

- This leads to a legit Google.com page asking you to authorize "Google Docs" to access to your Gmail account.                Except it's not actually the official Google Docs requesting access: it's a rogue web app with the same name that, if given the green light by unsuspecting marks, then ransacks contact lists and sends out more spam

- It also gains control over the webmail account, including the ability to read victims' messages and send new ones on their behalf.                Apparently no one at Google thought to block someone calling their app Google Docs.                @zeynep Just got this as well

- Super sophisticated

- pic.twitter.com/l6c1ljSFIX Zach Latta (@zachlatta) May 3, 2017                If the permissions are granted, the software will immediately spam out the same message to all the people on your contacts list, bypassing two-factor authentication if you have that set up on your account

- Here at Vulture West we've been getting bombarded with these emails, including some from journalists at other publications.                "There's a very clever phishing scam going around at the moment  originally thought to be targeting journalists given the sheer number of them mentioning it on their Twitter feeds, it's also been slinging its way across unrelated mailboxes  from orgs to schools / campuses," explained Christopher Boyd, malware intelligence analyst at Malwarebytes, today.                "This doesn't mean it didn't begin with a popped journo mailbox and spread its way out from there, or that someone didn't intentionally send it to a number of journalists of course  but either way, this one has gone viral and not in a 'look at the cute cat pic' fashion."                The emails do have some distinguishing characteristics

- They are all addressed to the same hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh@mailinator.com address, with the victims BCC'd, and sent from the last person to accidentally authorize the malicious app.                If you have fallen prey to the attack, there are steps that can be taken to ameliorate the situation

## All your Googles are belong to us: Look out for the Google Docs phishing worm

- A widely reported e-mail purporting to be a request to share a Google Docs document is actually a well-disguised phishing attack.

- If the victim clicks on the prompt to give the site permission to use Google credentials, the phish then harvests all the contacts in the victim's Gmail address book and adds them to its list of targets. The phish appears to have been initially targeted at a number of reporters, but it quickly spread widely across the Internet.

- Some of the sites associated with the attack appear to have been shut down. The e-mail uses a technique that a Trend Micro report linked last week to Pawn Storm, an ongoing espionage campaign frequently attributed to Russian intelligence operations.

- The attack uses the OAuth authentication interface, which is also used by many Web services to allow users to log in without using a password.

- By abusing OAuth, the attack is able to present a legitimate Google dialogue box requesting authorization.

## Dont trust OAuth: Why the Google Docs worm was so convincing

-                     An evil phishing worm masquerading as "Google Docs" took the internet by storm today

- An e-mail from a friend or relative claims they shared a document with you

- Clicking on the "Open in Docs" button asked you to log in to Google, then it popped up a familiar OAuth request asking for some permissions

- If you click "Allow," the permissions granted it full control over your e-mail and access to all your contacts

- The worm then e-mailed everyone in your contacts list, and did god-only-knows what else to the victim's e-mail.The interesting thing about this worm was just how convincing it was

- The e-mail was greatit used the exact same language as a Google Docs sharing e-mail and the exact same "Open" button

- Clicking on the link brought up an authentic Google login page, served up from Google's servers

- Then you were presented a real Google OAuth permissions page, also from Google's servers

## MP3 put out to pasture

- It's the end of an era, sort of: Fraunhofer IIS, the developers of the MP3 audio compression format, announced that they are ceasing their licensing program

- In a blog post, spokesman Matthias Rose says that it's had a good 20-year run and is obsolete

- But it's also true that the decoding patents expired last year, and the last encoding patents are soon to follow

- So there's not much hope of selling any licenses in any case.

## Encrypted WhatsApp Message Recovered From Westminster Terrorist's Phone

- 90764499story Encrypted WhatsApp Message Recovered From Westminster Terrorist's Phone  (indiatimes.com)   Bruce66423 brings word that a terrorist's WhatsApp message has been decrypted "using techniques that 'cannot be disclosed for security reasons', though 'sources said they now have the technical expertise to repeat the process in future.'" The Economic Times reports:U.K

- security services have managed to decode the last message sent out by Khalid Masood before he rammed his high-speed car into pedestrians on Westminster Bridge and stabbed to death a police officer at the gates of Parliament on March 22

- The access to Masood's message was achieved by what has been described by security sources as a use of "human and technical intelligence"..

-  The issue of WhatsApp's encrypted service, which is closed to anyone besides the sender and recipient, had come under criticism soon after the attack

- "It's completely unacceptable

- There should be no place for terrorists to hide

- We need to make sure that organisations like WhatsApp, and there are plenty of others like that, don't provide a secret place for terrorists to communicate with each other," U.K

- home secretary Amber Rudd had said. Security sources say the message showed the victim's motive was military action in Muslim countries, while the article adds that though ISIS claimed responsibility for the attack, "no evidence has emerged to back this up."

## IP Freely? Mr IP Freely? VoIP-for-suits firm battens down hatches after PBX data breach

-                                 Over the weekend FreePBX and PBXact users were warned of a security breach that spilled SIP credentials, potentially opening the door for fraudsters to make phone calls at the expense of small businesses that rely on the technology.                Sangoma, the Canadian firm behind the tech, warned in an updated customer advisory that around a month ago users of its SIP trunking service, SIPStation, were targeted by a hacker who gained "access to some users' randomly generated SIP credentials"

- These credentials were reset and reissued as soon as the incident was discovered.                The firm, which has already updated its SIPStation platform and tightened up access restrictions, decided it also needs to notify its FreePBX and PBXact users as a precaution after discovering that a small percentage of its small office telephony users may have been exposed to toll fraud.                About a month ago we had one of our trunking servers attacked, resulting in an illegal hacker getting access to some users' randomly generated SIP credentials

- At the time of that incident, we promptly communicated via email to all of our SIPStation customers about the issue, and worked with them to obtain new SIP credentials

- Our investigation into that attack resulted in a suite of new improvements to our platform as outlined in our SIPStation wiki, more specifically the section on notifications and access restrictions.Through our investigation we were able to track where in our infrastructure the hacker obtained access

- Although we have found no trace or evidence of them accessing our customer data, we have been notified of 14 systems that have been affected out of thousands of deployed systems

- Based on this we have determined that it's theoretically possible that these unlawful hackers could have gained access to some PBX data and left no trace

- Given this possibility we are sending this update to our broader group of PBX users beyond just our SIPStation subscribers.                Sangoma uses an unaffected third party to handle customer payments, meaning it can assure customers that their payment details are still safe.                Frederic Dickey, VP of marketing and product management, confirmed that last weekend's breach notice advisory was genuine

- "A few clients out of hundreds of thousands, report[ed] to us that their PBX had been hacked, and Sangoma thus decided to be proactive with our customers," he told El Reg.                SIPStation provides North American SMEs and enterprises with a telephony services using a standard internet connection.                Dickey explained the potential impact of the hack against the service: "If a malicious party were to gain access to a customer's SIP credentials, that party could be able to make calls using the customer's account (sometimes referred to as toll fraud)

## Thieves drain 2fa-protected bank accounts by abusing SS7 routing protocol

- Security researchers demonstrated this dark side of SS7 last year when they stalked US Representative Ted Lieu using nothing more than his 10-digit cell phone number and access to an SS7 network. In January, thieves exploited SS7 weaknesses to bypass two-factor authentication banks used to prevent unauthorized withdrawals from online accounts, the German-based newspaper Suddeutsche Zeitung reported.

- Instead of being delivered to the phones of designated account holders, the text messages were diverted to numbers controlled by the attackers.

- SS7-facilitated compromises, by contrast, can be done remotely on a much larger quantity of phone numbers. Telecom confirms SS7 abuse "A criminal attack from the network of a foreign provider... in mid-January, that incoming SMS for singled numbers in Germany unauthorized were redirected," a representative with Germany's O2 Telefonica told a Suddeutsche Zeitung reporter, according to an English translation of the German-language article.

- The unidentified foreign provider has since been blocked and affected customers were informed of the breach. The potential for widespread abuse of SS7 first came to light in 2008, but awareness remained largely limited.

- In 2014, The Washington Post explained how it was becoming increasingly easy for SS7 to be exploited by both government intelligence agencies and non-state actors.

## After years of warnings, mobile network hackers exploit SS7 flaws to drain bank accounts

-                                 Experts have been warning for years about security blunders in the Signaling System 7 protocol  the magic glue used by cellphone networks to communicate with each other.                These shortcomings can be potentially abused to, for example, redirect people's calls and text messages to miscreants' devices

- Now we've seen the first case of crooks exploiting the design flaws to line their pockets with victims' cash.                O2-Telefonica in Germany has confirmed to Suddeutsche Zeitung that some of its customers have had their bank accounts drained using a two-stage attack that exploits SS7.                In other words, thieves exploited SS7 to intercept two-factor authentication codes sent to online banking customers, allowing them to empty their accounts

- The thefts occurred over the past few months, according to multiple sources.                In 2014, researchers demonstrated that SS7, which was created in the 1980s by telcos to allow cellular and some landline networks to interconnect and exchange data, is fundamentally flawed

- Someone with internal access to a telco  such as a hacker or a corrupt employee  can get access to any telco's backend in the world, via SS7, to track a phone's location, read or redirect messages, and even listen to calls.                In this case, the attackers exploited a two-factor authentication system of transaction authentication numbers used by German banks

- Online banking customers need to get a code sent to their phone before funds are transferred between accounts.                The hackers first spammed out malware to victims' computers, which collected the bank account balance, login details and passwords for their accounts, along with their mobile number

- Then they purchased access to a rogue telecommunications provider and set up a redirect for the victim's mobile phone number to a handset controlled by the attackers.                Next, usually in the middle of the night when the mark was asleep, the attackers logged into their online bank accounts and transferred money out

- When the transaction numbers were sent they were routed to the criminals, who then finalized the transaction.                While security experts have been warning about just this kind of attack  and politicians have increasingly been making noise about it  the telcos have been glacial at getting to grips with the problem

- The prevailing view has been that you'd need a telco to pull off an assault, and what kind of dastardly firm would let itself be used in that way.                That may have worked in the 1980s, but these days almost anyone can set themselves up as a telco, or buy access to the backend of one

## Your Next Desktop... QNX?

-  QNX has a long checkered history as an embedded operating system.

- That is, kernel functions run as a set of coordinated tasks instead of as a single piece of code.

- Qt exists on QNX, but with a setup that favors the embedded system (for example, everything shows full-screen).

- Building Qt apps was possible, but without a proper window manager, it still wasnt the desktop experience he wanted.

- However, it is a great story of the kind of difficulties involved in making something offbeat useful, a problem weve mentioned before when you build your own CPU.

- Brown wrote about hacked emails that showed the firm Stratfor spying on activists on behalf of corporations

- Brown also helped uncover a proposal by intelligence contractors to hack and smear WikiLeaks defenders and progressive activists

- Just last week, Brown was interviewed for two days by VICE, and his PBS interview was set for Friday.

## Show HN: VPS Comparison  Automated tests to compare VPS by yourself

- A comparison between some VPS providers that have data centers located in Europe. Initially Im comparing only entry plans, below 5$ monthly. What I trying to show here its basically a lot of things that I would want to know before sign up with any of them.

- In order to minimize the hassle and avoid any controversies (Apache vs Nginx, which DB, wich PHP, what cache to use, etc) and also make all the process easier Im going to use the Bitnami stacks to install both programs.

- Even when Im not specially fond of Bitnami stacks (I would use other components), being self-contained helps a lot to make easier the task as atomic and revert the server at the end to the previous state.

- I could use a linear plot, but that would make me to change the gather python script and I think thats clear enough in this way. Of course, the key here is the amount of memory, the plans that support more load are also the ones that have more memory. More valid requests is better. 100 connections

- The purpose is to test if you are restricted in any way to use a different SO than the ones officially supported. The Distro install script fails partially in OVH and Linode, requires your manual intervention, that does not mean that you are not able to do it, only that youll probably need more work to do it.

## NSA Halts Collection of Americans' Emails About Foreign Targets

- 90748681story NSA Halts Collection of Americans' Emails About Foreign Targets  (nytimes.com)   The NSA is stopping one of the most disputed forms of its warrantless surveillance program (alternative source), one in which it collects Americans' emails and texts to and from people overseas and that mention a foreigner under surveillance, NYTimes reports on Friday citing officials familiar with the matter

- From the report: National security officials have argued that such surveillance is lawful and helpful in identifying people who might have links to terrorism, espionage or otherwise are targeted for intelligence-gathering

- The fact that the sender of such a message would know an email address or phone number associated with a surveillance target is grounds for suspicion, these officials argued

- [...] The N.S.A

- made the change to resolve problems it was having complying with special rules imposed by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court in 2011 to protect Americans' privacy

- For technical reasons, the agency ended up collecting messages sent and received domestically as a byproduct of such surveillance, the officials said.

## AMDs stock plunges to biggest loss in over 12 years

- Shares of Advanced Micro Devices Inc. plunged on heavy volume Tuesday, to suffer their worst day in over 12 years, as the chipmakers results didnt live up to analysts high hopes. The company reported late Monday first-quarter results that were mostly in line with expectations, but analysts expressed concern over the margin outlook.

- AMDs new products are beginning to accelerate growth, but perhaps without all the gross margin benefits we had hoped for, he wrote in a note to clients. Rolland kept his rating at neutral, and his stock price target at $12, which is now about 17% above current levels.

-  UBS analyst Stephen Chin affirmed his sell rating on the stock and $9 price target, which calls for a further selloff of about 13%, on concerns that the margin expansion story could take more time to develop. We keep our sell rating on the stock as we see limited EPS growth near term to support its high multiple as it need to invest heavily to keep pace with Intel and Nvidia, Chin wrote.

- Analyst Ruben Roy at MKM Partners said AMD appears to be executing largely according to plan, with the shipment of its new Ryzen desktop processors during the first quarter, and the results didnt change is fundamental view of the company.

- However, the margin outlook is a concern as the shares appear fairly valued. While we do not find lumpy gross margin performance all that surprising as AMD transitions into a number of new product launches, we do understand investor disappointment with a step back given the buzz around Ryzen, Roy wrote. The stock has lost 9.0% year to date, while the PHLX Semiconductor Index

## UEFI Secure Boot Booted From Debian 9 'Stretch'

- Debian's release team has decided to postpone its implementation of Secure Boot.

- From a report: In a release update from last week, release team member Jonathan Wiltshire wrote that "At a recent team meeting, we decided that support for Secure Boot in the forthcoming Debian 9 'stretch' would no longer be a blocker to release.

- The likely, although not certain outcome is that stretch will not have Secure Boot support."

- "We appreciate that this will be a disappointment to many users and developers," he continued, "However, we need to balance that with the limited time available for the volunteer teams working on this feature, and the risk of bugs being introduced through rushed development."

- The decision not to offer Secure Boot support at release leaves Debian behind Red Hat and Suse, making it the only one of Linux's three main branches not to support the heir-to-BIOS and the many security enhancements it offers.

## As Print Surges, Ebook Sales Plunge Nearly 20%

- 90768601story As Print Surges, Ebook Sales Plunge Nearly 20%  (cnn.com)   An anonymous reader quotes CNN:Sales of consumer ebooks plunged 17% in the U.K

- in 2016, according to the Publishers Association

- Sales of physical books and journals went up by 7% over the same period, while children's books surged 16%

- The same trend is on display in the U.S., where ebook sales declined 18.7% over the first nine months of 2016, according to the Association of American Publishers

- Paperback sales were up 7.5% over the same period, and hardback sales increased 4.1%...  Sales of e-readers declined by more than 40% between 2011 and 2016, according to consumer research group Euromonitor International

- "E-readers, which was once a promising category, saw its sales peak in 2011

- Its success was short-lived, as it spiraled downwards within a year with the entry of tablets," Euromonitor said in a research note

-  The article includes an even more interesting statistic: that one-third of adults tried a "digital detox" in 2016, limiting their personal use of electronics

## Neowin: Microsoft's Windows Phone Business 'Is Dead'

- An anonymous reader quote Neowin: If you've been expecting Microsoft to issue a press release formally announcing the end of its Windows phone business, you're probably hoping for a bit too much.

- That figure has now dropped to virtually nothing... Today, as Microsoft published its earnings report for Q3 FY2017, it revealed that its "Phone revenue declined $730 million".

- Based on its earlier financial disclosures, that means the company's phone hardware revenue fell to just $5 million for the entire quarter ending March 31, 2017.

- During Microsoft's earnings call today, its chief financial officer, Amy Hood, acknowledged this, stating that there was "no material phone revenue this quarter".

- The outlook for the next few months is similarly bleak, as Hood predicted "negligible revenue from Phone" in the coming quarter.

## OAuth Worm II - The revenge

- We all know about this massive Google Doc Phishing Attack that hit about 1 million accounts right?Image from https://arstechnica.com/security/2017/05/dont-trust-oauth-why-the-google-docs-worm-was-so-convincing/Well this really "sophisticated attack" (really??) was based on a really spread Internet procol named OAuth

- It also turns out that during the early stage of the standardization someone reported this very own attack vector but as often happens he was ignored

- Back in 2015 I also reported another "hidden feature" of OAuth that turns an OAuth server into an open redirector that makes phishing a piece of cake.Yesterday I was twitting about this and today I decided to imitate Eugene Pupov (lol) and work on my master thesis project

- So this is the resulting mail

- Have fun:Fret not, go ahead and click and you will be redirected to: that is not a Github page but is rather controlled by me.Well that's all folks

-  For more OAuth phishing follow me on Twitter

- P.S

- for the record me and some other folks from the OAuth working group proposed a draft  (3 years ago!!!) that should close this open redirector

- VULNERABILITY-------------------------WordPress Core = 4.7.4 Potential Unauthorized Password Reset (0day)II

- BACKGROUND-------------------------"WordPress is a free and open-source content management system (CMS) based on PHP and MySQL.WordPress was used by more than 27.5% of the top 10 million websites as of February 2017

- WordPress is reportedly the most popular website management or blogging system in use on the Web, supporting more than 60 million websites."https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WordPressIII

- INTRODUCTION-------------------------Wordpress has a password reset feature that contains a vulnerability whichmight in some cases allow attackers to get hold of the password reset linkwithout previous authentication

- Such attack could lead to an attacker gaining unauthorised access to a victim's WordPress account.IV

- DESCRIPTION -------------------------The vulnerability stems from WordPress using untrusted data by defaultwhen creating a password reset e-mail that is supposed to be delivered onlyto the e-mail associated with the owner's account.This can be observed in the following code snippet that creates a Fromemail header before calling a PHP mail() function:------[ wp-includes/pluggable.php ]------...if ( !isset( $from_email ) ) {        // Get the site domain and get rid of www.        $sitename = strtolower( $_SERVER['SERVER_NAME'] );        if ( substr( $sitename, 0, 4 ) == 'www.' ) {                $sitename = substr( $sitename, 4 );        }        $from_email = 'wordpress@'

- $sitename;}...-----------------------------------------As we can see, Wordpress is using SERVER_NAME variable to get the hostname ofthe server in order to create a From/Return-Path header of the outgoing passwordreset email.However, major web servers such as Apache by default set the SERVER_NAME variableusing the hostname supplied by the client (within the HTTP_HOST header):https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/core.html#usecanonicalnameBecause SERVER_NAME can be modified, an attacker could set it to an arbitrarydomain of his choice e.g:attackers-mxserver.comwhich would result in Wordpress setting the $from_email to wordpress@attackers-mxserver.comand thus result in an outgoing email with From/Return-Path set to this malicious address.As to which e-mail header the attacker would be able to modify - From orReturn-Path, it depends on the server environment

## Qubes kicks Xen while it's down after finding 'fatal, reliably exploitable' bug

-                                 Qubes is once again regretting how long it's taken to abandon Xen's PV hypervisor, disclosing another three bugs including host escape vulnerabilities.                The most serious bugs are in PV (paravirtualization) memory handling, XSA-213 and XSA-214.                An attacker who exploits either of these bugs can break Qubes-provided isolation

- This means that if an attacker has already exploited another vulnerability, e.g

- in a Web browser or networking or USB stack, then the attacker would be able to compromise a whole Qubes system Qubes says in this note.                The bug in XSA-213 only affects 64 bit x86 systems and relates to how root and user mode page tables are handled by 64-bit PV guests

- The IRET hypercall, which stands in for identically-named CPU instructions, transfers control from user mode to kernel mode.                If such an IRET hypercall is placed in the middle of a multicall batch, subsequent operations invoked by the same multicall batch may wrongly assume the guest to still be in kernel mode, Xen explains, with the result that the guest could get writable access to the wrong root page table.                This means a buggy or malicious PV guest may be able to access all of system memory, allowing for all of privilege escalation, host crashes, and information leaks.                The bug in XSA-214 is in an operation that lets guests pass pages between each other, but there's a bug in the GNTTABOP_transfer operation.                The internal processing of this, however, does not include zapping the previous type of the page being transferred

- This makes it possible for a PV guest to transfer a page previously used as part of a segment descriptor table to another guest while retaining the 'contains segment descriptors' property.                The result is, once again, a complete host escape: a malicious pair of guests can get access to all system memory, resulting in privilege escalation, host crashes, and information leaks.                Pair of guests is an important qualifier, as Qubes notes in its document, since it requires cooperation between two VMs of different types, which somewhat limits its applicability.                Finally, there's XSA-215

- It falls short of the all of system memory-level seriousness of the previous two, but it's plenty bad enough.                A guest attack could modify part of a physical memory page not belonging to it, with the resulting attack vectors covering privilege escalation, host crashes, crashing other guests, and information leaks.                The bug is in Xen's exception handling, which under some conditions means it returns to guest mode not via ordinary exception entry points, but via a so call failsafe callback

- This callback, unlike exception handlers, takes 4 extra arguments on the stack (the saved data selectors DS, ES, FS, and GS).                Prior to placing exception or failsafe callback frames on the guest kernel stack, Xen checks the linear address range to not overlap with hypervisor space

- The range spanned by that check was mistakenly not covering these extra 4 slots.                As with XSA-214, this bug is confined to 64-bit Xen on x86 (in this case, version 4.6 and earlier), and with particular physical memory boundaries (5 TB or 3.5 TB).                We're getting sick of this                Of the four bugs, Qubes says XSA-213 is the worst (fatal, reliably exploitable it says), and there's more than a hint of frustration in its discussion.                Over eight years, Qubes complains, there have been four Xen bugs in the same class, all of them relating in Xen mechanisms for handling memory virtualisation for paravirtualised (PV) VMs.                Qubes says after XSA-212 emerged ten months ago, we immediately began working on a way to move away from using PV-based VMs and toward using only hardware-based virtualization (HVM) VMs in Qubes 4.x  but this is turning out to be harder than it looks.                The major undertaking delayed Qubes 4.0, the outfit says, and even then, there's still stuff on the to-do list.                We originally hoped we could transition to running all Linux VMs in a so-called PVH mode of virtualization, where the I/O emulator is not needed at all, but it turned out the Linux kernel is not quite ready for this.                So, in Qubes 4.0, we will use the classic HVM mode, where the I/O emulator is sandboxed within..

## Meet Greyhound.com, the site that doesnt allow password changes

-                   Enlarge / This is what Greyhound.com e-mails you when you forget your password.    When it comes to websites with bad password policies, there's no shortage of bad actors

- Sitessome operated by banks or other financial servicesthat allow eight- or even six-character passwords, sometimes even allowing letters to be entered in either upper- or lower-case? Yup

- Sites that e-mail forgotten passwords in plaintext? Sadly, all the time

- Ars largely stopped reporting on them because they're better covered by Twitter accounts like this one.But recently, I saw a site policy so bad I couldn't stay quiet

- It's Greyhound.com, a site that among other things lets people book bus travel and redeem rewards for past trips

- The site allows passwords as short as four charactersincluding 1234

- And when a user forgets a password, Greyhound.com will send the plaintext of the PIN or password in e-mail, an indication that the site isn't using any sort of cryptographic hashing to protect user passwords in the event that Greyhound's database is ever breached.Worst of all: Greyhound.com provides no mechanism for changing a password

## 'First Pirated Ultra HD Blu-Ray Disk' Appears Online

- 90841627story 'First Pirated Ultra HD Blu-Ray Disk' Appears Online  (torrentfreak.com)   Has AACS 2.0 encryption used to protect UHD Blu-ray discs been cracked? While the details are scarce, a cracked copy of a UHD Blu-ray disc surfaced on the HD-focused BitTorrent tracker UltraHDclub

- TorrentFreak reports:  The torrent in question is a copy of the Smurfs 2 film and is tagged "The Smurfs 2 (2013) 2160p UHD Blu-ray HEVC Atmos 7.1-THRONE." This suggests that AACS 2.0 may have been "cracked" although there are no further technical details provided at this point

- UltraHDclub is proud of the release, though, and boasts of having the "First Ultra HD Blu-ray Disc in the NET!" Those who want to get their hands on a copy of the file have to be patient though

- Provided that they have access to the private tracker, it will take a while to download the entire 53.30 GB disk

- TorrentFreak reached out to both the uploader of the torrent and an admin at the site hoping to find out more, but thus far we have yet to hear back

- From the details provided, the copy appears to be the real deal although not everyone agrees

-

## Ask HN: Is it a waste of time to teach yourself data science without a degree?

- In which case you can omit the class because you have proof of learning, not just trying to learn.Even better is I provided business value V to my employer by building X. Because now youre showing how this skill is useful to someone else.

- Yes you could learn some of the frameworks and libraries out there, but I think you will miss the bigger picture if you do not grasp the fundamentals.Even brushing up on probability and linear algebra has benefits.

- Most ML people are academics who tend to not have good software engineering skills, finding people who master both domains is really hard.Also to add to that most of the work in ML is feature engineering, data cleaning, testing and building pipelines which all require a good software engineering background.  carlmcqueen 36 minutes ago  I work for a technical statistical team in the financial world, weve been hiring PHDs lately to my team which has just meant exactly what this comment points out.I do a lot of the grunt work of getting the data sourced, cleaned and ready and am called the data wizard and other such annoying names.Whats frustrating is I can run the last lines of code and read and understand the output of the last step, but as the original question asked, management would prefer someone with a phd or masters in customer analytics to be the expert of the data output.  Helmet 27 minutes ago  Really?

- Later on, you can even work at Google if you want - just make a great product and get acquihired.Three tips on what you should do instead:1) BUILD something and show off your skills.

- If youre a Scala dev and regularly work with something like Spark and Hadoop you could probably find an entry level data science job at a non-FB/Google company because your programming and framework experience are much needed.

- The calling process can however retrieve the error code of thelast verification error using SSL_get_verify_result(3) or by maintainingits own error storage managed by verify_callback

## Leaked: The UK's secret blueprint with telcos for mass spying on internet, phones  and backdoors

- The UK government has secretly drawn up more details of its new bulk surveillance powers  awarding itself the ability to monitor Brits' live communications, and insert encryption backdoors by the backdoor. In its draft technical capability notices paper [PDF], all communications companies  including phone networks and ISPs  will be obliged to provide real-time access to the full content of any named individual within 24 hours, as well as any "secondary data" relating to that person. That includes encrypted content  which means that UK organizations will not be allowed to introduce true end-to-end encryption of their users' data but will be legally required to introduce a backdoor to their systems so the authorities can read any and all communications. In addition, comms providers will be required to make bulk surveillance possible by introducing systems that can provide real-time interception of 1 in 10,000 of its customers.

- " The live surveillance of individuals will require authorization from senior police or secretaries of state, overseen by a judge appointed by the prime minister.

- And there are a few safeguards built into the system following strong opposition to earlier drafts of the Investigatory Powers Act. Closed doors What will concern many, however, is how the draft paper and its contents are being handled. The technical capability notices paper has only been provided to a select few companies  mostly ISPs and telcos  on a short four-week consultation, but a copy of the draft found its way to the Open Rights Group, which has published it online today. According to the document, it has already passed through the UK's Technical Advisory Board, which comprises six telco representatives  currently O2, BT, BSkyB, Cable and Wireless, Vodafone and Virgin Media  plus six people from the government's intercepting agencies, and a board chairman. That means that the contents have already been largely agreed to by most of the organizations that have been included in the closed consultation. It is unclear whether the Home Office intends to make it available for public comment after that time or whether it will seek to push it through the legislature before anyone outside the consultation group has an opportunity to review it. The rules will have to be formally approved by both houses of Parliament before becoming law. You ain't see me, right? The process and the approach seem to be purposefully obscure.

- And the only reason we know about it is presumably because someone at one of the few companies that have been sent the draft rules decided to tell Open Rights Group about it. But what the nine-page document does is provide the government with the legal authority to monitor anyone in the UK in real time, as well as effectively make strong and unbreakable encryption illegal. This act of stripping away safeguards on people's private data is also fantastic news for hackers, criminals, and anyone else who wants to snoop on Brits.

-   PS: The Home Office ran a short public consultation earlier this year on a code of conduct for government snoops.

## A Sophisticated Grey Hat Vigilante Protects Insecure IoT Devices

- Ars Technica reports on Hajime, a sophisticated "vigilante botnet that infects IoT devices before blackhats can hijack them."

- It also displays a cryptographically signed message on infected device terminals that describes its creator as "just a white hat, securing some systems."

- But unlike the bare-bones functionality found in Mirai, Hajime is a full-featured package that gives the botnet reliability, stealth, and reliance that's largely unparalleled in the IoT landscape...  Hajime doesn't rashly cycle through a preset list of the most commonly used user name-password combinations when trying to hijack a vulnerable device.

- The encryption and decentralized design make Hajime more resistant to takedowns by ISPs and Internet backbone providers. 

- Pascal Geenens, a researcher at security firm Radware, watched the botnet attempt 14,348 hijacks from 12,000 unique IP addresses around the world, and says "If Hajime is a glimpse into what the future of IoT botnets looks like, I certainly hope the IoT industry gets its act together and starts seriously considering securing existing and new products.

## Proposed Internet Freedom Act permanently guts net neutrality authority

- " The full bill text isn't available yet, but it appears to be identical to another one proposed last year.

- The FCC finally was able to impose net neutrality rules that were upheld in court after reclassifying ISPs as common carriers.

- Among other things, the rules prohibit ISPs from blocking, throttling, or prioritizing Internet websites and applications in exchange for payment.

- Some Republicans in Congress support net neutrality legislation that would ban blocking, throttling, and paid prioritization of Internet traffic without using Title II.

- But from what we know about Lee's bill so far, it appears the proposal wouldn't impose any type of net neutrality rules to replace the current ones.

## US Appeals Court Won't Rehear 'Net Neutrality' Challenge

- A federal appeals court on Monday declined to rehear a challenge to the Obama administration's landmark "net neutrality" rules requiring internet providers to guarantee equal access to all websites.

- From a report: The decision by the full appeals court in Washington not to reconsider a three-judge panel's decision that upheld the ruling comes days after Federal Communications Commission Chairman Ajit Pai proposed to undo the 2015 net neutrality that reclassified internet providers like public utilities.

- The 2015 order bars internet providers from blocking, throttling or giving "fast lanes" to some websites.

- Pai has proposed reversing the reclassification and scrapping internet conduct standards, and has asked for comment on whether the FCC can or should retain any of the rules barring blocking, throttling or "fast lanes."

- Judge Sri Srinivasan said in a written opinion reviewing the decision "would be particularly unwarranted at this point in light of the uncertainty surrounding the fate of the FCC's order.

## Hacker leaks Orange is the New Black new season after ransom demands ignored

-             An individual or group going by the name "thedarkoverlord" has posted much of the upcoming season of Netflix's series Orange is the New Black, apparently as punishment for not paying an extortion demand

- According to information obtained by Databreaches.net, the episodes were stolen from a post-production studio along with episodes from dozens of other television programs on Netflix and other networks

- And the person or people behind the breach are not attempting to further extort the networks that distribute the programs.Whoever is behind "thedarkoverlord" has over the past year breached a number of small and mid-sized organizations' networks, apparently by exploiting common vulnerabilities in their websites to gain access

- In each case, according to Twitter posts and Pastebin notes by the hacker or hackers, they have posted proof of breaches to GitHub and attempted to extort payments in bitcoins from the victims, threatening to dump customer data and other records if they failed to comply

- One target was a US Navy supplier, according to a report from DataBreaches.net (though no sensitive information was part of the breach).Late last year, thedarkoverlord managed to stumble into a mother lode, apparently gaining access to the network of Larson Studios, an audio post-production company that serves many of the major television production companies

- And with that access, they managed to steal nine episodes of the upcoming season of Netflix's series, Orange is the New Black and claimed to have accessed content from 36 television series and one film

- They attempted to extort 50 bitcoins from Larson, setting a January deadline

- And when that deadline passed, they apparently decided to move on to extorting each of the companies producing the content individually.On April 29, after Netflix failed to respond to their extortion demands, thedarkoverlord posted links on Twitter to torrents of the episodes

## Red alert! Intel patches remote execution hole that's been hidden in biz, server chips since 2010

-                                 For the past nine years, millions of Intel workstation and server chips have harbored a security flaw that can be potentially exploited to remotely control and infect systems with spyware.                Specifically, the bug is in Intel's Active Management Technology (AMT), Standard Manageability (ISM) and Small Business Technology (SBT) firmware versions 6 to 11.6

- According to Chipzilla, the security hole allows "an unprivileged attacker to gain control of the manageability features provided by these products."                That means it is possible for hackers to log into a vulnerable computer's hardware  right under the nose of the operating system  and silently tamper with the machine, install virtually undetectable malware, and so on, using AMT's features

- This is potentially possible across the network because AMT has direct access to the network hardware, as well as being possible with local access.                These insecure management features have been available in various, but not all, Intel chipsets for nearly a decade, starting with the Nehalem Core i7 in 2008, all the way up to this year's Kaby Lake Core parts

- Crucially, the vulnerability lies at the very heart of a machine's silicon, out of sight of the operating system, its applications and any antivirus.                The programming blunder can only be fully addressed with a firmware-level update, and it is present in millions of chips

- It is effectively a backdoor into at-risk computers all over the world.                The vulnerable AMT service is part of Intel's vPro suite of processor features

- If vPro is present and enabled on a system, and AMT is provisioned, unauthenticated miscreants on your network can access the computer's AMT controls and hijack them

- If AMT isn't provisioned, a logged-in user can still potentially exploit the bug to gain admin-level powers

- If you don't have vPro or AMT present at all, you are in the clear.                Intel reckons the vulnerability affects business and server boxes, because they tend to have vPro and AMT present and enabled, and not systems aimed at ordinary folks, which typically don't
